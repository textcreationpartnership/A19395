            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>IVERS haue hitherto diuerſly
reported of this Action &amp; of the

matter (falling out not many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths

freſh remembrance of many: yet ſundry there are which
hitherto know not the very particular dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and outrages, into which theſe men burſt out,
and the moſt part (I thinke) haue not heard what was the
originall cauſe of ſuch their diſcontentment, or the
maine drift and purpoſe of all their deſignments, nor of
any the wayes and meanes by them vſed, for furthering
and atchieuing the principall ſcope they ſhot at, nor of
any their counſels and cariage of the action, nor yet who
were their complices that were made acquainted with
the matter, in ſome generall or more ſpeciall termes.</p>
            <p>By want of knowledge of which things, ſundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
and ſiniſter conceits and miſdeemings haue ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,

ſeeme meete to be abated, and reformed in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9293:3"/>
For the Papiſt our common enimie, in ſome late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
from beyond the ſeas, hath (as I am informed) wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
theſe mens dealings to another end. And ſundry at
home, who would ſeeme more moderate then many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their owne iudgement, yet in fauour of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or (which I iudge rather) vpon liking of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in matter of church-gouernement, haue allowed
their meanings to haue bene good, though they miſlike
(ſomwhat they ſay) of the maner. Others ſeek to diſguiſe
the very purpoſes of theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if that which (in trueth)
was moſt, had bene leaſt of all entended by them. There
are ſome alſo, purpoſing to extenuate the fault, and to
preuent that ſo iuſt a blot may not fall vpon the meaneſt
fauourer of pretended reformation, who will needs make
them to haue bene ſtarke madde, and ſuch as knew not

who vnder pretence of pitie and commiſeration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, are ſayd not to ſpare to mutter abroad, that
matters are made worſe and of greater conſequence and

others were proſecuted with greater vehemencie and
ſharpeneſſe, then the cauſe it ſelfe or qualitie of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall

            <p>All which vntrue ſurmiſes and imputations, what doe

from ſuch calumniations, and to make manifeſt alſo the
very trueth of theſe matters vnto all that are deſirous to
be enformed aright in them: it is thought meete that this
treatiſe (for good conſiderations hitherto ſtaied ſince it
was finiſhed) ſhould now at length be publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Whereby I make no doubt, but it will appeare to any

theſe cauſes are to be throughly looked into, for

howe farre ſoeuer (perhaps) they may ſeeme vnto ſome

So farre is her excellent Maieſtie, and the whole ſtate

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN in the tyme of profeſsing the
trueth of religion, ſuch as pretend grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſinceritie and zeale, doe fall into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticall
fanſies and dangerous attempts:
then ſome doe thereupon ſtagger in the
doctrine, and are ſcandalized: ſome be
quite driuen backe: and others are caried
euen with open mouth to ſlander and to
reproch the very profeſsion of the Goſpell. The two firſt of which,
are of the weaker, but the laſt are of the wickeder ſort. For theſe
are ſtraight way ready to make compariſons betwixt the times,
and to declaime largely, concerning the ſweete and golden quiet,
with agreement in iudgement, which they (erroneouſly) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
to haue continually accompanied the times of ſuperſtition
and blindnes.</p>
            <p>But though this were vniuerſally true, which is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
yet both the one ſort and the other, are dangerouſly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and tranſported into miſdeeming by want of due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what is the very well-ſpring and occaſion of ſuch accidents
vnder the profeſsion of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Sathan</hi> the deceiuing enemie of mankind, had in
the times of <hi>Poperie</hi> by inſenſible and as it were obſcure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
(vnder a colour of religion and deuotion) enuenomed once
the very fountaines of doctrine with many peſtilent errours,
much ſuperſtition, and groſſe <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and had almoſt quite
dammed vp the light of the glorious Goſpell: then was it no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
though he here reſted his labours, as being (in ſome ſort) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
vnto the maine ende of all his drifts and purpoſes. In ſo
much as this once atchieued, the reſt were ſufficiently able to goe
forward of themſelues. For vpon corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith &amp; doctrine,
muſt needes enſue either open corruption of life and conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or at leaſt corruption, masked vnder a vaile of hypocriſie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:9293:4"/>
he that walketh in darknes, knoweth not whither he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and a corrupt tree cannot bring foorth good fruite. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after the victorie gotten, that he might more deepely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
and ſurely retaine, whome he had caught, he thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
(at ſome ſeaſons) vpon theſe corruptions, to weaue a vaile
of pretended vnitie, and as it were to candie and ſweeten them
ouer with the louely ſhewe of peace and agreement: which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
being without Veritie, is nothing elſe, but a lewde
Conſpiracie, and is rather a deadly ſleepe wherewith men be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed,
then an vnitie of the ſpirite in the bond of peace.
For where all is ſubdued, what needes any further reſiſtance?
And where a ſtrong man keepes the houſe, all that he poſſeſſeth
are in quiet, till a ſtronger then he doe come to diſpoſſeſſe him.</p>
            <p>But when as God taking compaſsion of his Church in the eies
of his mercie, had in theſe latter times made the day-ſtarre to
ſhine againe in our hearts, no ſooner did the beames of his Goſpell
beginne to glimpſe and breake foorth, but the old craftie ſerpent
(knowing his kingdome to be inuaded a freſh, and his time but
ſhort) began in great wrath to rouſe vp himſelfe againe, and to
hammer ouer a new, all his long approued wicked experiments,
and to plant newe engines for the diſcredite and hinderance of
the paſſage and propagation of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>This he plotteth (beſides many other meanes) by ſeducing
ſome that profeſse it, into ſedition and errour: and ſo in their
perſons he bringeth the profeſsion it ſelfe into obloquie and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with ſuch, as afore did thinke hardly of it, or were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
it was the trueth. For by reaſon of his <hi>Angelicall</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
corrupted with <hi>Diabolicall</hi> malice, and by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
euen of 5553. yeeres continuance, he is nowe become <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>mille-artifex,</hi> his perfite crafts-maſter in infinite deuiſes
and ſubtilties. So that he doeth at ſundry times very manifoldly
and variably ſuggeſt and plot, not onely ſeuerall and diuers, but
ſometimes euen contrary opinions and actions, one to another;
howbeit all to one and the ſelfe ſame generall ende, <hi>of ſeducing
<pb facs="tcp:9293:5"/>
mankinde.</hi> Therefore (amongſt his infinite deceites for hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Goſpell, and of mans ſaluation by it) ſome whome he
cannot peruert in doctrine, he ſeeketh to attaint in life. Others
whome he cannot ſo eaſily ſeduce in their conuerſation, he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſoweth his cockle &amp; darnel of ſuperſtition, ſchiſme, &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
in their hearts, and ſo peruerteth them in iudgement, and
matter of religion. Some whom he cannot entangle by one ſinne,
he tempteth to ouerthrowe by a ſinne contrary vnto it. Others
whom he cannot ſnare by groſſe and actual ſinnes, he gets ground
of, by making them haue ouer great eſtimation of their owne

of the true qualitie or cauſe of things, as when, not being

&amp; faith in deede, do either wholly ſlippe by vntaught, or els are ſo
ſleightly and ignorantly ſlubbered ouer by ſuch Preachers, that
the common aduerſarie the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is thereby rather hardened

            <p>Out of this head ſprings alſo that errour of ſome, who doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
all diſorder and perſonall faultes of men about execution
of lawes, vnto the lawes themſelues, and vnto the verie pollicie
<pb facs="tcp:9293:5"/>
of the Church: thereupon gathering with themſelues, that the

as a <hi>Mithridate</hi> and ſoueraigne ſalue, to heale (with ſhort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying)
all diſeaſes and ſores, both of Church &amp; Common wealth.
Certaine be ſo bewitched (in like ſort) by a kind of admiration of
that, which is (in it ſelfe) moſt neceſſarie, as that in the meane
time they ouerſlippe matters of no leſſe importance in the life of
a Chriſtian, becauſe they thinke it ſufficient, to be occupied onely
about the other.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it commeth, that ſundry doe attribute ſo much to
the hearing of the word preached, that neither publike nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
reading of Scripture, workes of charitie, praying, nor pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of that which is preached, is any whit almoſt regarded of
them. Whereby they are alwaies learning, but neuer come vnto
the knowledge of the trueth, as if the very worke wrought of
hearing alone could make them good and perfect Chriſtians. So
that where in olde time there were certaine heretikes called <gap reason="foreign">

putting all religion in bare <hi>hearing</hi> of Sermons. Diuerſe alſo
there are, who are ſo whetted againſt the abuſe of things, that
the <hi>Seducer</hi> hereby taketh opportunitie, to drawe them to omit
euen the good and commendable vſe of them. Such are thoſe, that
becauſe they will not ſeeme to confirme Gods trueth by humane
teſtimonie, doe therefore deſpiſe all light and helpe of good artes,
and learned Interpretors, and in ſteede of them, doe in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
nothing els, but blaſe out their own friuolous and vnſound
Collections, trifling out the time (without order and methode)
by an heape of earneſt and reſonant, but vndigeſted wordes,
vaine repetitions, <hi>tautologies</hi> and <hi>battologies,</hi> without any
ſubstance of matter, to the great abuſe of their auditorie, and of
that excellent worke. Many alſo are ſo afraide to fall into ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
obſeruation of daies, commanded for abſtinence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding

want of natural affection, as a ſinne: yet ſuch perſons, when

ſuperſtitious ſingularitie) auoid all ſhew of ſorow, as if it were a
matter vnlawful for any Chriſtians, of their degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And therefore they take vnto themſelues at ſuch times, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,

Howbeit, the holy Ghoſt greatly commendeth the deuotion

and gifts: whot and bloodie panges of malice and crueltie, for
motions of Gods ſpirite and reuelation from him, with ſuch like
a great many, moe them a good number. All theſe and ſuch like,
are vſuall practiſes and ſleights of <hi>Sathan,</hi> whereby euen in the
time of the Goſpel, he cunningly inueigleth and ſlily entrappeth
many, to the danger of themſelues, to the ſcandall and downe-fal
of others, and to the obloquie of true religion. <hi>It is neceſſarie</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that offences come: yet woe be to them, by
whome they come.</hi> And <hi>there muſt needes be hereſies</hi>
(ſaith S. <hi>Paul) that ſuch as be approoued, may be made
manifeſt.</hi> But of all the other, the laſt ſort of them (being ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
by <hi>Sathan,</hi> vnder the viſard of vertue, godlines; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)
are moſt pernicious and diueliſh: and the poiſon of them
ſpreadeth and ranckleth furtheſt, to the disturbance and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
both of Church and Common-wealth, becauſe hereby the
<hi>Diuell</hi> transfourmeth himſelfe into an <hi>Angell</hi> of light. For
as the most noble creature engendred, is moſt loathſome and
baſe in his corruption: ſo is the vntrue pretence and colour
of pietie and religion (thinges of themſelues of chiefest price
and excellencie) the most daungerous ſnare and deadly dart,
that <hi>Sathan</hi> can ſhoote-foorth.<note place="margin">Macchiauel.</note> The prophane politique of

<pb facs="tcp:9293:7"/>
was the readieſt and ſureſt way, to blinde and ſeduce a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
If then this impe of his, could marke it, ſhall we doubt, but
that <hi>Sathan</hi> himſelfe, the forger of all ſubtilties, can ſee it, and
accordingly alſo put it in practiſe? Yea, he hath put in vre this
moſt dangerous deuiſe, not onely in this action (whereof we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate)
done in our late ſight and knowledge, by his ſeduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments

of which examples recorded in hiſtorie, it ſhall not (I truſt)
be amiſſe to compare with theſe late attempts and actions: both
that the one and the other may be better knowen, and auoided
hereafter, and that the efficacie of this ſtrong illuſion, may more
fruitfully be weighed and conſidered.</p>

aſſaied this practiſe ſo like (in moſt pointes) to the former in

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE of the three principall perſons in
this Action (whereof wee intreat) was
<hi>Edmund Coppinger,</hi> a gentleman deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of a good houſe and linage, and one
of her <hi>Maieſties</hi> ſworne ſeruaunts, but a
yonger brother, hauing no great liueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
His chiefe abode (as I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
for ſome yeeres paſt, hath bene in
and about the Citie of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of them is <hi>Henry Arthington,</hi> a gentleman likewiſe,
whoſe place of birth and dwelling is ſaid to be in <hi>Yorkeſhire:</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
for the greateſt part of certaine yeeres paſt, hee hath remained
and ſoiourned in or about <hi>London.</hi> It is conſtantly (how credibly I
know not) reported by ſome, who pretend to know it, that this
<hi>Arthington</hi> (at the times of his long aboades at <hi>London)</hi> did moſt
conuerſe with another gentleman of <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> by whoſe meanes,
he preſently ſtands more deepely engaged, then his meane eſtate
might well beare, and whoſe companie is feared to haue wrought
in him ſmall duetifull opinion of the godly reformation planted
and eſtabliſhed by the meanes of her <hi>Maieſtie.</hi> It is diſcouered by
the mutuall letters of <hi>Arthington</hi> and the aforeſaid other <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi>

the <hi>Counſell, Iudges,</hi> and this whole <hi>Estate,</hi> were receiued &amp; diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

            <p>Now by ſuch remaining about the Citie of <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington,</hi>
they fell to be acquainted together for ſome yeeres paſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe two made ſemblance, and ſo were holden to bee profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of the Goſpel, neither of the coldeſt or lewke-warme ſort, (as
ſuch doe vntruly terme others, who bee in deed godly wiſe, with a
ſober moderation) but rather of thoſe that more iuſtly may bee
ſaid, to be ſcalding hote in deſire of <hi>innouation,</hi> which they falſely
call <hi>reformation.</hi> They therefore ſtanding thus affected, moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ſorted themſelues in familiaritie with ſuch, as by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor
may ſeeme to repoſe a great part of their Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and zeale in the onely reproching, and odious traducing of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9293:8"/>
and gouernment Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>Theſe two hauing itching eares, moſt vſually heaped to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and made choiſe to heare and follow ſuch preachers, as
were thought fitteſt to feede their humour: which preachers, with
their ſad lookes, frequent ſighes abroad, long and vehement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
prayers, bitter and playne inuectiues in priuate, and priuie
deprauing in publike, of the lawes and policie Eccleſiaſticall, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with their vſuall ſpeeches, beſides ſundry infamous libels and
other pamphlets ſpred alreadie for aduauncing that gouernement
(which they ſtrangely terme <hi>The Diſcipline)</hi> may ſeeme ſo to
haue inflamed theſe two perſons, as that they thought this <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
a worthie ſubiect whereupon they ſhould ſpend moſt of their
actions and cogitations.</p>
            <p>Their mindes being thus prepared, it happened that ſome prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of this <hi>Diſcipline</hi> were begun to bee proceeded with in the
moſt honourable court of <hi>Starre chamber,</hi> about the ſame time
that this <hi>Coppinger</hi> (by meanes of one <hi>Giles Wigginton)</hi> came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>William Hacket,</hi> the third actor and chiefe ſetter
foorth of this tragedie.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſayd <hi>Wigginton</hi> (becauſe this alſo tendeth
to the better vnderſtanding of the whole action) he was borne or
bred vp in <hi>Oundel</hi> in <hi>Northhamptonſhire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (where <hi>Hacket</hi> dwelt)
and he often reſorted into that countrey by that occaſion. He was
not long ſince a miniſter, and Vicar of <hi>Sedberghe</hi> and <hi>Dent</hi> in the
North partes, but for his intollerable inſolencies and contempts
agaynſt lawes, and the peace of the Church, was both depriued
of that his benefice, and depoſed from his miniſterie by authoritie
of her <hi>Maieſties</hi> commiſſion for cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, a man (by
report of ſuch as know him beſt, and fauour him not a litle) whoſe
zeale neuer came behind knowledge, nor bold-hardie forwardnes,
at any time went after diſcretion in him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hacket</hi> had dwelt alſo by a long ſpace in <hi>Oundel,</hi> where
firſt he ſerued one maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> an Eſquier, by the ſpace of tenne
yeeres: and after, for ſome time hee ſerued Sir <hi>Thomas Treſham</hi>
Knight: he was a notable bragging and quarelſome fellow, yet
thought in trueth to be but a very recreant daſtard.</p>
            <p>He long together vſed one lewd &amp; vngodly practiſe, which was
to reſort vnto ſermons (of purpoſe) to gibe, mocke, and carpe at
them: and hauing a good memorie (which was the onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9293:8"/>
part in him) he vſed in ſcoffing maner to preach ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in alehouſes, the ſermons that hee had heard, moſt inſiſting
and ſporting himſelfe and others at ſuch paſſages thereof, which
pleaſed him leaſt, or whereat he imagined any likely matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding
might be gathered.</p>
            <p>Whiles thus hee ſerued Maſter <hi>Huſſey,</hi> hee obtained (by his
maſters countenance) the mariage of one <hi>Moretons</hi> widowe, of
reaſonable ſubſtance, hauing alſo a good Farme in that towne.
But hee, following looſe and licencious companie, and an idle
courſe of life, without labour or induſtrie either to get or ſaue,
lewdly and riotouſlie miſpent and waſted in ſhort ſpace all her
goods.</p>
            <p>It fell ſo out, that at length hee pretended from a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi>
to be couuerted to religion and knowledge of the trueth: at
what time he grew to be of familiar and inward acquaintance with
the ſaid <hi>Giles Wigginton,</hi> and was an eſpeciall follower and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his, both at publike ſermons and priuate conuenticles. Of
late times hee was alſo conſorted in partnerſhip of malt-making
with <hi>Wigginton:</hi> their great acquaintance and familiaritie may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by a letter ſent from <hi>Hacket</hi> vnto him, the third of March laſt,
and by his lending vnto <hi>Hacket</hi> of ten pounds: the ſuperſcription
is, <hi>To the worſhipfull Miniſter of Gods word, M. Giles Wigginton at
Newgate.</hi> In the letter thus hee writeth: <hi>M. Wigginton I deſire to
communicate my ſpirit at large with you, but I know not your keeper.</hi> And
in the ende thereof, thus: <hi>Good M. Wigginton make my ſound heart
knowen to maſter Cartwright, maſter Snape, maſter Vdall, maſter
Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his and ſuch others (like affected mens) inſtructions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of life and behauiour, he ſo profited, that in ſhort ſpace hee
proued one that profeſſed with the forwardeſt, and practiſed with
the frowardeſt. For falling as fooles doe, from one extremitie to an
other, <hi>Qui dum vitant vitia, in contraria currunt,</hi> he grew to a moſt
inſolent, proude, and contemptuous diſdaine of all preachers and
others whomeſoeuer, that flew not his pitch, or lay not to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
of his pretended zeale. But moſt gladly and with greateſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
that might be, hee vſed to ſpend his mouth largely in inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues,
railings and contumelies againſt Biſhops and other gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of the Church, and alſo againſt the lawes, orders, and whole
gouernment Eccleſiaſticall, not ſticking (as was probably ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9293:9"/>
to procure alſo ſundry lewd infamous libels againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
other preachers, &amp;c. to be framed and ſet vp thereabouts.</p>
            <p>His deteſtation of Eccleſiaſticall orders commaunded, was ſo
great, that he could not endure to frequent the ſermons which <hi>Ray</hi>
the miniſter of that towne did preach, becauſe he ſeemed to him a
little more conformable in ſome few matters (by authoritie eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed)
then <hi>Hacket</hi> liked of. Wherfore on <hi>Sabboth</hi> dayes <hi>Hacket</hi>
vſually did reſort to a place a mile off called <hi>Stoke</hi> (where the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
fitted his humor better) in companie of ſome of like ſtrayne to
himſelfe, and of certaine light idle goſſips, whereof ſome of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt
were ſayd to loue and like him ſo little, as that ſhe could oft
times be content to take the meate off his trencher, which hee had
cut for himſelfe, and to eate it vp from him. But whenſoeuer this
deuout flocke came ſo neere to <hi>Stoke</hi> Church, as they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the miniſter to be yet at diuine ſeruice and prayer: then they
vſed to ſtay abroad and reſt themſelues in the Greene churchyard
there (without going into the Church) vntill they heard the
Pſalme begun before ſermon, for feare leaſt they ſhould be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by thoſe prayers.</p>
            <p>One moſt memorable pranke (aboue others) was played in
<hi>Oundell</hi> by <hi>Hacket,</hi> which is renoumed farre and neere for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
brutiſhneſſe of it. It hapned that M. <hi>Huſſey</hi> his maſter fell at
debate and was offended with one <hi>Freckingham</hi> an artificer of the
towne. This <hi>Frechingham</hi> had a ſonne which was a ſchoolemaſter,
who (as in nature hee was bound) did take part with his father.
Now <hi>Hacket</hi> meeting this ſchoolemaſter in an Alehouſe or Inne,
did louingly (as ſeemed) ſignifie vnto him how ſorie hee was, that
there ſhould bee any breach betwixt his maſter and him the ſayde
ſchoolemaſter, entertaining him (that ſuſpected no trecherie) with
ſuch good ſpeeches, till ſpying an aduantage, hee ſo graſped both
<hi>Freckingham</hi> his armes, as that he might eaſily hold him and throw
him to the ground. Thus hauing gotten him down on the ground
vnder him, <hi>Hacket</hi> moſt ſauagely and curriſhly bit off the poore
ſchoolemaſter noſe with his teeth, which when hee had ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
performed, both the ſayd <hi>Freckingham</hi> and one <hi>Clement</hi> (a
cunning Surgion) inſtantly deſired the noſe of him agayne, that
whiles the wound was freſh and greene, it might bee ſtitched on
and grow againe (as they conceiued it would) to auoyd ſo fowle
and great deformitie: but the <hi>Canibal</hi> varlet not onely vtterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9293:9"/>
ſo to part with it, but held it vp triumphantly, and ſhewed it
with great vaunterie and glorie, to all that would behold it: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as ſome haue reported) did in a moſt ſpitefull &amp; diueliſh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
eate it vp.</p>
            <p>In proceſſe of time it happened that his maſter fell out with
him, and put him from his ſeruice (I thinke for no good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
yet it is ſayd that hee was retayned afterward in ſeruice (by
what meanes I knowe not) with a very worſhipfull gentleman Sir
<hi>Charles Morriſon</hi> knight, nephew to his firſt maſter: and one of
thoſe, againſt whom hee lately cauſed his two ſmall prophets ſo
vily to exclaime, and ſo vnwoorthily to charge, euen openly in
<hi>Cheapeſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides his former vertues and good qualities, this <hi>Hacket</hi> was
alſo a verie great ſwearer and blaſphemer of the name of God, in
his yonger yeares: which courſe, when afterward, to retayne the
reputation of a profeſſor of the Goſpell (whereof hee made great
pretence) hee was forced to leaue, hee turned his ſingle oathes (in
trueth) into worſe and more horrible, ioyned with moſt fearefull
imprecations againſt himſelfe, when ſoeuer hee would make any
aſſeuerations, wherein he deſired to be credited, as namely theſe:
<hi>ſo God iudge mee, I renounce God,</hi> and <hi>God confound</hi> and <hi>damne mee,</hi>
or doe ſo, or ſo vnto me, if this bee not true: which was ſo vſuall,
and by long cuſtome ſo inueterate in him, euen till the time of his
apprehenſion, that in the midſt of his counterfeit holineſſe (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee ſeduced <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington)</hi> hee often burſt foorth
into this kind of execration agaynſt himſelfe, as an eſpeciall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
(amongſt others) to haue his wordes to be better beleeued by
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Arthington</hi> noted this courſe of <hi>Hackets</hi> as a notable vertue
in him, and a matter of care zeale. <hi>His maner</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>of praying
is as it were ſpeaking to God face to face, denouncing his iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
himſelfe, if hee diſſemble, lie, or ſeeke himſelfe in any thing, but
the honour of God onely. He prayed ſo confidently for maiſtreſſe</hi> H. <hi>that
he charged God to haue giuen her vnto him, to reſtore her to her former
health and libertie euerie way, ſaying, Lorde, according to thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
thou haſt power, and I haue fayth, therefore it ſhall come to
paſſe.</hi> This maiſtreſſe <hi>H.</hi> is a Gentlewoman of <hi>London,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
or feareth to bee poſſeſſed with a diuell now foureteene
yeeres together.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe he was giuen to quaffing and drunkenneſſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9293:10"/>
not onely a Maltſter, but a Malt-worme, and was addicted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to laſciuious life with women, which commonly accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the other vicious exceſſe: for credite whereof, his owne ſtorie
or legend (which himſelfe endited as a notable monument of his
excellent vertues and ſpeciall holineſſe) may giue too ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie:
for therein hee telleth of many temptations in this kind
with women, which (as himſelfe confeſſeth) hee reiected not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither,
but went further then either godlineſſe or yet ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie
would permit. But he pretendeth that theſe baites were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and laied by his enimies (who ſought matter againſt him) as
ſnares and trappes whereby to take his holineſſe tardie, that belike
was ſo hard to be entangled. Inſomuch as <hi>Arthington</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
of that hiſtorie (which hee did whiles hee was yet ſeduced
by <hi>Hacket)</hi> doeth ſtampe this brand and cenſure vpon it, that
they were prophane ſpeeches and matters of women, which hee
would not haue ſet downe, but that hee could not otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
the villanous practiſe which <hi>Hackets</hi> enemies intended for
the ouerthrow of the Goſpell of <hi>Christ,</hi> as he moſt childiſhly and
ridiculouſly excuſed then the matter. For further proofe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of his laſciuious diſpoſition, it is alſo enformed from the
place of his aboade, that on a time (vnder colour of giuing godly
counſell) hee attempted to haue wickedly rauiſhed a poore mans
daughter, whereupon hee was forced to ſtep aſide out of the way,
for a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Neither did the wickedneſſe of this wretch here reſt it ſelfe:
for hee was vehemently holden in ſuſpicion, for committing alſo
of ſundry robberies.</p>
            <p>But that which maketh vp the heape of all wickedneſſe, is
this: that the ſinke of theſe ſinnes in him, hee alwayes ſmoothlie
couered and parieted ouer (eſpecially for ſundrie late yeeres)
with a very rare outward earneſtneſſe in profeſſion of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and with a moſt entire (yea burning) deſire of reforming
(forſooth) the Church and common wealth, by eſtabliſhing the
<hi>Preſbyteriall Diſcipline,</hi> which hee did imagine would prooue like
the boxe of <hi>Pandora,</hi> for it promiſeth cure for all maladies and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
            <p>But this his zeale and deſire of reformation, begun then moſt
of all to enkindle it ſelfe in him, and to breake foorth, after that
(by riotous miſpending and licentious life) hee had waſted the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9293:10"/>
wealth that he had with the widow, whom hee maried, whoſe hap
was very hard to match with him, albeit hee made more of her
then ſhee deſired, for he made the vttermoſt penie. For then hee
begunne with counterfeit holineſſe to ſet out himſelfe (amongſt
ſuch of the ſimpler ſort as had zeale without knowledge) to bee
a man indued with an extraordinarie and ſingular ſpirite, ſuch as
(in olde time) the prophets and holy men of God were: making
ſhew withall, as if he had ſome peculiar gifts and qualities, to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
euen to tell ſecrets and worke myracles, which many beleeued:
whereof ſome did attribute them to ſorcerie and enchauntments,
but the ſimpler ſort vnto his rare ſpirite and holineſſe.</p>
            <p>For hee truſted by this perſwaſion to get ſuch credite with the
vnſtable multitude, as that by their hands he might one day bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(whoſoeuer ſhould withſtand it) to bring his purpoſes about,
for erecting of ſuch pretended <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> to his owne great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and aduauncement. In this vayne and ſeduecing humour,
hee is reported (I know not how truely) to haue trauelled in the
North partes vnto <hi>Yorke:</hi> for among the ſimpler people (where he
was not knowen) hee hoped by the viſard of holineſſe and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not a litle to preuaile, in ſetting forwards his deſignments. For
which purpoſe he tooke vpon him there the office and ſpirite of S.
<hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> affirming, that hee was ſent thither by God, to prepare
the way of the Lord before his ſecond comming to iudgement.
But the conterfeit holines &amp; lewd ſeducing purpoſe of the varlet
being diſcouered vnto ſome in authoritie, he was welcommed not
with loſſe of his head (as that holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vniuſtly was, whom he wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
counterfeited) but was wel whipped &amp; after baniſhed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> city.</p>
            <p>This medicine wrought not ſo effectually with him, as that it
could terrifie him wholy from the like attempts. For it is reported,
that after this he aſſaied againe to put on the like perſon or maske
at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where he alſo found the ſame cheere &amp; entertainment
for his paines, as he receiued afore at <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this erroneous opinion (whereby through ſelfe-loue and
illuſion of the deuill, he thought that hee was reſerued of God for
ſomegreat and excellent worke, being blowen forward by the
ſhew of zeale, and of an earneſtneſſe for ſuch a reformation) could
not thus eaſily be quenched and rooted out of him: the rather, for
that by vſe and imitation of ſuch as he moſt followed &amp; conuerſed
with (though otherwiſe he were wholy vnlettred) he had growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9293:11"/>
ſuch a dexteritie in conceiuing of extemporall prayers, with bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſted
and thundering wordes, as that he was thereby meruailed
at, and greatly magnified by ſome brethren and ſiſters, as a man
greatly vouchſafed with God, and adourned with rare and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
endowments from heauen, ſo that through adimiration of ſuch
ſuppoſed excellencies in him, he ſtill continued to fanſie vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that hee had rare gifts and an <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling. For hee
gaue out to diuers that hee was a <hi>Prophet</hi> of Gods vengeaunce,
where his mercy is refuſed: ſaying that <hi>If Reformation be not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in England this preſent yeere, three great plagues ſhall fall vpon
it, the ſword, peſtilence and famine.</hi> Hee pretended alſo that God
had reuealed vnto him moſt wonderfull things, <hi>Which he would</hi> (he
ſayd) <hi>vtter to none but ſuch as himſelfe knew to be very reſolute in Gods
cauſe:</hi> But he told vnto <hi>Arthington</hi> and <hi>Coppinger, that there ſhould
be no moe Popes hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon confidence of which ſpirit and gifts in himſelfe, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his reſort, with an intemperate and fanaticall boldneſſe, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as if he had ſufficient warrant for it) he dared oftentimes to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
moſt vile, lewd, and ſeditious ſpeaches both of the Queenes
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> and of certaine the greateſt ſubiects whom hee thought
to be hinderers of his practiſes. Which his outrages being once or
twiſe brought vnto the eares of certaine in authoritie in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire,</hi>
and elſwhere (not ſufficiently acquainted with the ſtrange
humours of ſuch <hi>Anabaptiſticall</hi> wiſards and fanaticall ſectaries)
and perhappes vn willing to let his wordes bee drawen ſo farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
him, as they iuſtly might: they were therefore content
to attribute them to ſome ſpice of phreneſie in him, and in that
qualitie to bee corrected, rather then to conſtrue them to haue
proceeded from any ſetled and aduiſed malice, as the euent hath
ſince made moſt manifeſt they did. For in the whole courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
of other the ſpeaches and actions of his life, both before and
after, none alienation of minde or madneſſe, could bee noted in
him.</p>
            <p>At one of the times that hee was brought in queſtion for his
ſeditious, and in deed treaſonable ſpeaches, it happened that hee
was conuented before that honourable counſeller Sir <hi>Walter
Mildmay,</hi> who commaunded him (for more ſafegard) to be wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the night before he was to be conueied to <hi>Northhampton</hi>
gaole, at what time the counterfait diſſembling wretch, willed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9293:11"/>
his wife to let him lie alone in the chamber that was to be wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
for that he had to conferre with one, that would come vnto
him that night: inſinuating vnto her, as if he were to haue at that
time, ſome ſpecial conferences with God, or ſome Angell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it was ſtraightway blowen abroad thereabouts, amongeſt
the credulous multitude of thoſe, that either fauoured him for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
zeale, or feared him for ſorceries, that (albeit there were no
candles vſed) yet there was a great light (that night) ſeene ſhining
in his chamber: ſo that by this tale, the erroneous opinions afore
conceaued of him, were greatly encreaſed.</p>
            <p>After he had lien in <hi>Northhampton</hi> gaole a good ſpace, and was
to come vnto his triall (in the abſence of <hi>Sir Walter</hi> from thence)
the matter is thought to haue bene ſo handled by ſome (who in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of his forwardnes, would needes interprete his felonies to be
but follies) as that (none euidence being giuen againſt him) he
was diſmiſſed for that pull: vpon band entred, for his apparance,
when he ſhould be called for againe.</p>
            <p>Nowe <hi>Hacket</hi> (a man thus qualified as ye heare) was of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men thought by <hi>Wigginton</hi> moſt fitte and woorthie, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended,
and ſtraightly linked vnto <hi>Coppingers</hi> familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
as moſt aptly conſorting with his humorous conceite,
long ere this apprehended by him, whereof it ſeemeth <hi>Wigginton</hi>
was not ignorant, nor miſliked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their acquaintance was wrought in this manner, as</hi> Hacket <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth
in that diſcourſe (which they ſince call</hi> Hackets <hi>hiſtorie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged)
endited by himſelfe, written by</hi> Coppinger, <hi>and afterwarde
copied out faire by</hi> Arthington, <hi>as it ſhould haue gone to the preſſe,
being annexed to</hi> Arthingtons <hi>propheſie. For there it is ſaid:</hi> that
the Lord brought <hi>Hacket</hi> to London <hi>(about the beginning of</hi> Easter
<hi>terme laſt)</hi> to ſee what would be done againſt <hi>Iob Throgmorton,</hi> and
partly to recken with <hi>M. Wigginton</hi> about the making of malte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them together: At what time <hi>Wigginton</hi> ſaid, that there was
a Gentleman in the Citie, a very good man: but <hi>Hacket</hi> (as the Lorde
knoweth) did not thinke that there had bene one godly man in the land:
and ſuppoſed the twelfth Pſalme belonged to this time. When <hi>Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was deſcribing the man, and the matter that he was entring into,
viz. that the man whome he ſpoke of, had a meſſage to ſay to his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
concerning ſome practiſe entended againſt her, from dealing
wherein, the Preachers in London had wonderfully diſcouraged him:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9293:12"/>
then <hi>Hacket</hi> anſwered thus: did you ſo alſo? No ſaith <hi>Wigginton:</hi> then
ſaid <hi>Hacket,</hi> encourage him in any wiſe: for what know you, what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is, he hath to ſay? Hereupon <hi>Wigginton</hi> ſent for the ſaid <hi>Edmund
Coppinger</hi> to come to the Counter to ſpeake with him: who (by Gods
prouidence) came foorthwith, &amp; <hi>Wigginton</hi> willed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
one of the other, aſſuring <hi>Coppinger</hi> that he knew <hi>Hacket</hi> to be a
man truely fearing God, and ſuch a perſon, as by whoſe conference, God
might miniſter ſome comfort to <hi>Coppinger:</hi> whereupon they two, (viz.
<hi>Coppinger</hi> &amp; <hi>Hacket)</hi> went from thence preſently vnto <hi>Hackets</hi> cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at the ſigne of the Caſtle without Smith field barres: ſo ſoone as they
were entred the chamber, <hi>Coppinger</hi> deſired that before any ſpeeche
ſhould paſſe betweene them, they might firſt pray to God together, which
they did: <hi>Hacket</hi> ſpeaking to the Lord firſt. After which praier, <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
deliuered vnto <hi>Hacket,</hi> how he had bene very ſtrangely &amp; extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
moued by God to go to her Maieſtie, &amp; to tel her plainly, that the
Lords pleaſure was, that ſhe muſt (with all speede) reforme her ſelfe, her
family, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, &amp; the Church: &amp; that the Lord had further
told him, by what meanes al the ſame ſhould be done: but that ſecret he
would not then deliuer vnto <hi>Hacket.</hi> Then <hi>Copp.</hi> alſo praied vnto God,
deſiring him, if he would be with him, &amp; bleſſe that buſines (which he had
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his charge) that then he would both furniſh him with gifts fit
for ſoweightie an action, &amp; knit the heart of <hi>Hacket</hi> &amp; his, ſo together,
as <hi>Dauids</hi> &amp; <hi>Ionathans, Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aarons:</hi> for anſwer hereof, <hi>Hacket</hi>
tooke further time til the morning, at which time in the morning (apraier
being firſt made) <hi>Hacket</hi> laid al the Lords buſines (which was to be done
by himſelf) vpon <hi>Coppingers</hi> backe: telling him the Lord had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to it, &amp; would ſtand with him in it. <hi>Thus farre in this point go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But long before this time of their two firſt acquaintances, <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi>
(vpon his returne foorth of <hi>Kent,</hi> in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> terme laſt)
had ſignified vnto <hi>Arthington,</hi> and to one <hi>T. Lancaſter,</hi> a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
in <hi>Shoe-lane,</hi> (both being of his familiar acquaintance, and
whome he had requeſted to faſt and pray with him, for ſucceſſe in
obteining a widow) that <hi>God had ſhewed him the ſaid</hi> Copp <hi>great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
by reuealing ſuch a ſecret myſtery vnto him as was wonderful, being
in ſubſtance thus much,</hi> viz. <hi>that he knew away, how to bring the Queene
to repentance, &amp; to cauſe al her Councel &amp; Nobles to doe the like out of
hand, or els detect them to be traitors that refuſed:</hi> Al they by ſuch <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
meaning &amp; vnderſtanding (as it ſeemeth) the erecting of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9293:12"/>
their fanciful <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> For this phraſe being vſual w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of this matter, he thereby ſufficiently declared his mind to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they wel vnderſtood what was meant, without further a do.</p>
            <p>Nowe it had bene inconuenient that <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſhould all this
while conceale this myſterie (which he imparted vnto them, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Hacket)</hi> from <hi>Wigginton,</hi> who brought them acquainted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
vnto whom he ſo oft reſorted, and ſo highly aboue all other
Preachers eſteemed, <hi>for his reſolute dealings in Gods matters,</hi> as he
termes them: whome he alſo after aduouched vnto <hi>Arthington,</hi> as
an irrefragable witneſſe to be perſwaded by, that would iuſtifie the
trueth of <hi>Hackets</hi> torments, &amp; whom he alſo knew more often bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied,
for attaining of that <hi>diſcipline</hi> (which himſelfe alſo laboured
for) then perhaps for heauen it ſelfe. And you ſee, that he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done it, <hi>Wigginton</hi> not diſcouraging him therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This propoſition ſo made by</hi> Coppinger, Arthington <hi>ſaith,</hi> that he
&amp; <hi>Lancaſter</hi> miſliked, as a matter impoſſible by <hi>Copp.</hi> to be done, but by
the Lord Ieſus onely, &amp; ſuch, whereof the iſſue could not fall out well any
way, &amp; ſo put him off for the firſt time: <hi>not vnderſtanding, in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
&amp; by what ſpecial meanes,</hi> Coppinger <hi>conceaued, that ſuch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<hi>ſhould be wrought in the Queenes Maieſtie, &amp; in others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The maner and other circumſtances of the firſt reuealing of this
pretended myſterie,</hi> Coppinger <hi>himſelfe at large declareth in a letter
written the</hi> 4. <hi>of</hi> Februarie <hi>laſt, vnto</hi> T. C. <hi>in priſon: the occaſion of
writing it, he there ſaith, was the ſaid</hi> T. C. offer to take knowledge (by
writing) from him, of ſuch matter, as might induce him, to ſuppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to haue receaued ſome hope of ſpeciall fauour from God, to ſome spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
vſe: but yet, without warrant from the worde, direction of the holie
ſpirite, &amp; approbation of the Church, he was (he ſaid) moſt vnwilling to
enter into ſo great an action. <hi>The letter is long, but to this effect:</hi> that
vpon ſome extraordinarie humiliation of him, he, with ſome other, and
a guide of their exerciſe, ioyned in a faſt: their guide (in the euening)
ſpake of the vſe of fastes, &amp;c. and then willed the others to adde to that,
which he had deliuered, either for the generall, or particular cauſes,
which mooued them to humble themſelues: that a great part of the ſaid
night <hi>Coppinger</hi> founde himſelfe very extraordinarily exerciſed, &amp;c.
by ſuch a motiue, as he could not well deſcribe: partly comforted with
a wonderfull zeale, which he founde himſelfe to haue, to ſet foorth Gods
glorie any wayes, which lawefully hee might enter into: partly cast
downe by ſuch a burning fire of concupiſcence, as in his greatest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9293:13"/>
ſtrength of bodie, he had not founde the like: that the next day, he riding
into the Countrey, (as he ridde) fanſied to himſelfe, that there was leaue
giuen him to ſpeake to God, in a more familiar manner, then at any time
before: and alſo perſwaded himſelfe, that Gods ſpirite did giue him
many ſtrange directions, wherein the Lorde would vſe him to doe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
to his most glorious Maiestie, and to his Church. Vpon which, he
had thought to haue returned preſently backe, and to haue left his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
iourney: but going on, and after being returned backe, he imparted
to his former fast-fellowes the worke of God in him, and deſired they
might againe ioyne in the like, which he (with ſome other) went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with, to their comfort, but without their chiefe guide, for he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ioyne.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Hereupon (he ſaith) that he was againe ſtirred vp to ſuch
buſines of ſuch importance, as in the eyes of fleſh and blood, were likely
to bring much danger to himſelfe, and vnlikely to bring any good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to the Church of God: hereof he writte to ſome Preachers out of
the Realme, and to ſome in the Realme: at length he writte hereof to
one in the Citie that was ſilenced: who reſolued him, that God did yet
worke extraordinarily in ſome perſons to ſome ſpeciall vſes. Hereupon
he obteined this Preachers conſent to ioyne with him and about foure
others on the Lordes day, in a faſt: which day was choſen, that they might
not hinder their worldly affaires in the weeke, and that they vſed
meanes to haue notice giuen to ſome of the Preachers in priſon, of the day
of their humiliation, deſiring them to commend to God in their prayers
the holie purpoſes,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which any fearing God, ſhould (in time) attempt to
take in hand, by ſeeking to bring glorie to God, and good to the Church:
that in their prayers at the ſaide fast, he and others did beſeech God, that
if he had appointed to vſe any of them to doe any speciall ſeruice to him
and his, that to that ende he would extraordinarily call them, that he
would ſeale vp his, or their ſuch calling, by ſome speciall maner, by his holy
ſpirite, and giue ſuch extraordinarie graces and giftes, as are fit for ſo
weightie an action. The night following <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> he thought (in his
ſleepe) that he was caried into heauen: and there being wonderfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed
with the Maieſtie of God, and brightnes of his glory, he made a
loude, and moſt ſtrange noiſe, whereby he awaked his brother that lay
with him, and ſome in the next chamber. Since which time <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> I
finde euery day more and more comfort: and ſuppoſe, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in me, which my ſelfe am not ſo fit to iudge of: and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Church (I meane your ſelfe, and ſuch as you ſhall name vnto me,
becauſe I cannot come to you without danger to your ſelfe and me) to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9293:13"/>
looke narrowly into me: &amp; if I be thought to be any way miſlead, I craue
ſharpe cenſuring: if I be guided by Gods ſpirite to any good end, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſhall be adiudged, I ſhal be ready to acquaint you and them, with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities
and particularities, ſo farre foorth as you &amp; they be deſirous to
looke into. At this time, the ende of my writing is onely to acquaint you
with the occaſions of mine entring into this great action, and to haue your
further anſwere to ſome queſtions,<note place="margin">Note.</note> wherein I deſire to be reſolued: with

callings from God: whether may the ſame be found in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
where the Gospell is truely preached, and the Sacraments (in ſome

to the Lordes Table: whether (I ſay) may it be hoped for, that God (for

by giuing him a ſpirite aboue others,<note place="margin">Note.</note> to deale with the Magiſtrate in the

it can be truely ſaid, a man ſo placed (though furniſhed with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

and perfite calling of a Miniſter, or no?</p>
               <p>To theſe I finde <hi>Wiggintons</hi> reſolution made vnder his owne
hand, to this effect briefly, viz. That God hath, doeth, and will, from
time to time raiſe vp <hi>extraordinarie</hi> workers, and helpers, to his
Church, as <hi>Apoſtles, Euangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> where neede requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and as <hi>Nazarites, Healers, Admoniſhers</hi> in ſpeciall ſort, &amp; ſuch
like: that theſe cannot be knowen to themſelues, but by Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
nor to others, but by godly effects: That he who is ſo called,
neede not to aske many queſtions of mortall men for his calling,
yet muſt be approoued godly before he enterpriſe his worke, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if he haue bene a knowen wicked perſon before.</p>
               <p>That where the chiefe rulers of any houſe or Countrey, or the
moſt part of any houſe or Countrey be ignorant, &amp; vntaught, there
it may be truely ſaide, that houſe or Countrey is out of frame, deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
or waſte: much more then, when one part of 30. or 40. is not
wel framed, rightly taught, or guided, &amp;c. in that houſe or Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey.</p>
               <p>And in another paper of his owne hand, he auoucheth ſuch <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie</hi>
callings, by example of one that cried vp and downe
the ſtreetes in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> before it was beſieged, and by another,
which (he ſaith) the laſt <hi>Parliament</hi> came foorth of <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> to
<hi>London,</hi> ſaying he was charged from God by an <hi>Angell</hi> in a viſion,
to ſignifie great vengeance from God vpon the whole Realme, for
certaine great enormities by himſelfe (in another mans perſon) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely
and ſeditiouſly furmiſed. So that hereby it appeareth, that
<hi>Wigginton</hi> is the ſilenced Preacher, meant by <hi>Coppinger</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
letter, who reſolued him of <hi>extraordinarie</hi> callings in thoſe
daies: who conſented to faſt &amp; pray with him &amp; others, for a ſeale
&amp;c. of ſuch calling: and who (as he afterward affirmed to <hi>Hacket)</hi>
would not diſcourage <hi>Coppinger</hi> in his purpoſes.</p>
               <p>This conceite hereupon waxing ſtronger &amp; ſtronger in <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
he often came to <hi>Lancaſters</hi> houſe (where alſo <hi>Arthington</hi> then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9293:14"/>
lay) to confer with them: ſpecially to know the certaintie, whether
there were any <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling in this laſt age, &amp; how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
might be tried? They both told him (as is now ſaid) that they were
meere <hi>ordinarie</hi> men, not able to reſolue him, much leſſe to take tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of his gifts, &amp; therfore willed him to keepe his ſecrets to himſelf,
or elſe to go to others, that could better iudge of them. Wherupon
<hi>Copp.</hi> ſought for direction to diuers Preachers, &amp; others in <hi>London,</hi>
&amp; elſe where, of what ſetled diſpoſition may eaſily be coniectured:
for reſolution alſo herein (by the help of his diligent fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
in this buſines, <hi>Iohn ap Henry alias a Penry)</hi> he ſollicited y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Preachers (ſo theſe fellowes terme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) of ſome forrein parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may alſo be gathered by ſome letters written by him to a
Gentleman neere about a great</hi> Counſellour, <hi>that he bare the ſaide
Gentleman in hand, as if he had intelligence, touching ſome matter
of great ſeruice to her</hi> Maieſtie, <hi>and the Common-wealth, to be
imparted to the ſaid</hi> Counſellor. <hi>For in the copie of a letter of his, of
the</hi> 28. <hi>of</hi> Ianuarie <hi>laſt, he thus writeth.</hi> Your ſignification of ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
which you heard I was deſirous to doe, in diſcharge of my duetie to
her Maieſtie, may giue his L. cauſe to ſuspect, that I honour him not ſo
much as I doe. Your reuealing therof to his L. I do aſſure you, doth much
trouble me, becauſe I am not furniſhed with ſuch matter as I wiſh. My
meaning was therefore to haue forborne his L. trouble, vntill I had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out that, which my heart deſireth to doe, &amp;c. <hi>And in another letter
of his, written to the ſame Gent. the</hi> 1. <hi>of</hi> Febru. <hi>after, in this ſort:</hi> If
you think he looketh to haue me come to his L. (about any thing which you
haue put into his head) let me vnderſtand from you whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I may attend his
L. pleaſure, which being knowen, I will (according to my duetie) doe it,
though I wiſh my ſelfe to be freed, vntil I may knowe that, which may giue
his L. cauſe to thinke of me, as I doe deſire to deſerue, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now that this matter was the ſame wherof he deſired ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
may be gathered by a note of his owne hande, ſet vpon the
backe of theſe two copies, thus: viz. <hi>By theſe letters it may appeare,
what care I had to carry my ſelfe in this action.</hi> But in his letters (about
this matter) written vnto Preachers, &amp; others of his owne humor,
he goeth more plainely to worke, and declareth another purpoſe,
and that it is <hi>aſpeciall ſeruice by him to be done, to God and his Church,</hi>
and ſo no ciuill matter, as he elſewhere pretendeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I finde by a letter of another Gentleman of the Laitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. W.</note> 
                  <hi>dated
the</hi> 25. <hi>of</hi> Ianuarie <hi>laſt, and written vnto</hi> Coppinger <hi>in anſwere: that</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:9293:15"/>
Coppinger <hi>had ſent for him vp, to</hi> receaue aduiſe of him in ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of importance, tending to the true ſeruice of God, wherein he was
labouring: <hi>in the ende whereof are theſe wordes, viz.</hi> you are in a
plentifull ſoile, where you may vſe the aduiſe of many godly wiſe: vſe the
benefite thereof: and then (as Ioſhua <hi>ſaide)</hi> be bolde, and of a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
feare not to be diſcouraged for God, euen the mightie God, will
protect, and defend you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his ſolliciting the Preachers to take trial of his gifts &amp; extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
calling, it appeareth he vſed ſome more plainneſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much diſguiſing of the qualitie of the action, which he enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and likewiſe how faintly he was diſcouraged from it by them.
For in a letter of his vnto</hi> T. L. <hi>written the</hi> 29. <hi>of</hi> Ianuary <hi>laſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that</hi> M. E. (a Preacher) moſt Chriſtianly, wiſely, and louingly
perſwaded him to be careful &amp; circumſpect ouer himſelfe: to take heede
leſt he were deceaued by the ſubtiltie of Satan, and ſo miſlead: wherby he
might endanger himſelfe both for his libertie, eſtate &amp; credite, and alſo
be an hinderance to the great cauſe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which he would ſeeme to be most
deſirous to further, but withall, the ſaid <hi>M. E.</hi> concluded, that he would be
loath to quench the spirite of God in him, or to hinder his zeale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>About this time &amp; matter,</hi> Coppinger <hi>writ alſo another letter to</hi> T.
C. <hi>which thing (beſides the letter it ſelfe) appeareth alſo by a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his, written the</hi> 24. <hi>of</hi> February <hi>laſt, to one</hi> M. H. <hi>The whole
tenor of the letter vnto</hi> T. C. <hi>is (in mine opinion) meete to be here
inſerted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>in many reſpects, viz.</hi> Right Reuerend Sir, I haue with much
griefe bene put backe from doing ſome special ſeruice to God and to his
Church, which I hope time wil manifeſt, that I am appointed for: which if
it had bene done by enemies, it ſhould not much haue troubled me: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done by perſons as much regarded by me, as fleſh &amp; blood can regard
men, it goeth neere vnto me. From you I receaued this meſſage, that I
ſhould attempt nothing but by aduiſe of thoſe, whom you would procure to
counſel me: this was done from you in the name of the Lord of heauen &amp;
earth, &amp; therefore I obey it with great care and conſcience, expecting at
your hands, that Munday being the day appointed for conference, that it
may hold: that I may be iuſtifiedin my courſe, or condemned. The danger
that ſome ſtand in for their liues, is not vnknowen: and if I had not bene
letted,<note place="margin">Note.</note> I durſt haue ventured my life, to haue procured their releaſe ere
now. God helpe vs: I ſee wiſdome, zeale, courage, &amp; loue are ſeene but in
few, &amp; thoſe who would gladly vſe thoſe graces &amp; giftes which God hath
giuen them, cannot: but God ſeeth what is beſt to be done, and he will by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9293:15"/>
contrary effects bring to paſſe, whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. If you wil anſwer
my laſt queſtions, there may much vſe be made of them. I deſire them as
much in regard of others as my ſelfe, who am reſolued of diuers things,
whereof I craue to bee reſolued, which I doe to good purpoſe. And as you
commanded me (in the name of God) to be wiſe and circumſpect and to
deale by counſell, ſo, (as I may) I command you in the name of God, that
you aduiſe the preachers to deale ſpeedily and circumſpectly,<note place="margin">Note.</note> leaſt ſome
bloud of the ſaints be ſhed, which muſt needs bring down vengeance from
heauen vpon the land. Returne this letter I beſeech you to me, that I may
ſhew it (amongſt other things) when the meeting ſhall be, and commend
me &amp; my purpoſes to God in your holy praiers, that they may ſo far be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as himſelfe is the directer of them: God keepe vs euer his, this 14. of
Febr. <hi>There is alſo this poſtſcript.</hi> I am ſo full of worldly buſineſſe, as I
haue no time to attend this weightie action, but do onely waite vpon God
for the direction of his ſpirit, ſauing my heart and ſoule are ſtill mindfull
hereof, and to morow (by Gods grace) I will humble my ſelfe before his
maieſtie in faſting and prayer, &amp; hope, that God will ſtirre vp ſome other
to ioyne with me in ſpirit, though few or none in perſon doe, onely one I am
aſſured of,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the priſoners know it: I leaue it to them to ioyne or not, as God
mooues them, but if euer men will faſt and pray, I thinke it is now more
then time to doe it. <hi>The ſuperſcription was this:</hi> To my very louing
and reuerend friend maſter C.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He delt alſo (about this matter) with another gentleman of the

                  <hi>in one of whoſe letters written in anſwer vnto</hi> Coppingers, <hi>the</hi>

of ſome marke.</hi> I confeſſe <hi>(ſaieth he)</hi> I heard ſome buzze abroad of a
ſole and ſingular courſe, that either you or ſome other had plotted in his
head. <hi>And a little after thus:</hi> I would wiſh you and all that beare good
will to the holy cauſe in this perillous age of ours, to take both your eyes in
your hands (as they ſay) and to bee ſure of your ground and warrant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſtriue to put in execution.<note place="margin">Striue to put in execution.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides theſe and ſome others, he inſtanted both by worde and
letters (in</hi> Easter <hi>terme laſt) about this buſineſſe, a certaine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
In his firſt letter to the ſayd gentleman, dated</hi> 19. <hi>of</hi> May

man, in ſuch a glorious action, ſo pleaſing to God, ſo behoouefull to his
Church, which ſhall alſo remaine of record here to all poſteritie. <hi>And a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after thus:</hi> If after your owne holy priuate prayer you find any deſire
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9293:16"/>
of ſpeach, with me, let me intreat you, either to ſend this letter to M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,
or rather (if you can) carie it vnto him, &amp;c. <hi>The ſecond letter
which he writ to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Lawyer the</hi> 21. <hi>of</hi> May <hi>(they hauing in the

ſpirit (O gracious father) direct vs now and for euer, in all our wayes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in thoſe, whereby greateſt honor may redound to thy glorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
moſt benefit to thy church, and moſt danger to thine enemies.</p>
               <p>Good Sir and my louing brother in the Lord, though ſuch as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to conſult with God, &amp; haue by prayer &amp; meditation much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
and acquaintance with his holy maieſtie, need not doubt of good
ſucceſſe, in all things which he ſetteth them a worke in, (though Satan &amp;
his vaſſals croſſe their courſe, &amp; hinder their labour by all the means they
can) yet is it alſo neceſſary that while we remain in the felowſhip &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the ſaints, that we communicate one with another, that as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
children we may all ioyne togither, to helpe each other, to be doers of
our heauenly fathers will here on earth, as the angels do it in the heauens.
The conſcience which I had hereof, enforced me to write vnto you lately,
and the like mooued you to ſpeake with mee vpon that letter. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I did obſerue many things (in that litle time we ſpent together) were
ſayd &amp; done, which might mooue either of vs to prayſe our good God, &amp;
to cheere vs vp,<note place="margin">Note.</note> to further ſo holy an action as now is in hand, which muſt
needs ſpeed well in the end, becauſe it is the Lords owne worke. And if we
aduenture our ſelues to do him ſeruice here, he will reward elſewhere. You
may be bold, for you haue the warrant of the worde, the allowance of the
ſtate, and you walke in your owne calling: But I am to be fearfull and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect,
becauſe the dangers I enter into, be infinite, my courſe miſliked
(though vnknowen) becauſe it is extraordinarie, which callings be cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in all mens opinion of iudgement, and haue not (of long time) bene
heard of, or to bee hoped for, but where the word is not preached at all, or
the Church in a great waſte, which no body dare affirme our Church of
England to be. Wherfore it ſeemeth that euery ſtep that I ſhal make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
ſhall be vpon thornes, &amp; therefore I am to feare pricking: yet for all
this I am not without hope, neither is the ſame grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded but by good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
The end why I write vnto you, is this, to intreat you to giue thanks to
thoſe holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all on my behalf, who are now in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I haue reaped much
benefit from them, by their cariage towards me, though they know it not:
for I durſt not (in regard of danger which might growe to them) viſite
any of them, ſince I found my ſelfe caried with a zeale to doe ſomewhat
in the ſame cauſe, for which they ſuffer. If by ſome effects hereafter I may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9293:16"/>
ſhew it, that is it which I deſire to doe, and in the meane time doe what I
can to perſwade the ſaints, that in this action I ſeeke Gods glory and not
mine owne. I haue bene heretofore put backe and diſſwaded from attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
any thing (leaſt I marred all) by the wiſest, the learnedſt, the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſeſt
and holieſt preachers of this Citie, great cauſes and weightie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
moouing thereunto. But yet this will not make me leaue it, but ſtill I
am enforced (by little and little) to labour to make my ſelfe fit to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me the managing of it. Wherefore if it pleaſe you to ſhew the other let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and this, and beſeech them from me to lay them before the Lord, when
they ſhall meete and ioyne togither in prayer: and if the Lords ſpirite ſhall
aſſure their ſpirites, that he hath bene, is, and will be with me in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(how hard ſoeuer it ſeemeth to be) let me by their meanes be vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
this fauour, that I may be allowed confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the preachers of the
Citie: which ſute I make not for that I would ſeeke to haue approbation
from them, or any other liuing creature, but from God himſelfe: or that I
purpoſe to doe that which heretofore I haue bene aduiſed vnto,<note place="margin">Note.</note> namely,
acquaint the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the courſes (which I purpoſe by Gods aſſiſtance to take
in hand) whereby great danger might grow to them, and little good to me:
but that my cariage towards them, may witnes vnto them the humilitie
of my mind, and lowlineſſe of my ſpirit, &amp; care and conſcience not to enter
into the matter, without offer to haue my gifts examined, &amp; if they ſhalbe
ſuppoſed to be ſuch as the church may haue vſe of, then let all holy means
be vſed, which ſhalbe aduiſed to be fit to be done in ſuch a dangerous time,
and weightie action. So beſeching God to gouern vs in all our wayes, and
preſerue vs in all our dangers, and ſupply vs with whatſoeuer we ſtand in
need of, I humbly and heartily commend you to God, this 21, day of
May, 1591.</p>
               <p>The effect of the ſpeeches which <hi>Coppinger</hi> had with him at their
conference (as the ſaid gentleman himſelfe reported) was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers committed, to incourage him to the
defence of it, adding that it was the trueth of God, &amp; that in the end
it would preuaile. Then the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> began to declare vnto
him his reuelations, his great faſting and prayer, and how God had
indued him with an extraordinarie grace of prayer, perſwaſion or
propheſie: &amp; that God had appointed him (as he was perſwaded)
to reueale the will of God touching the <hi>reformation</hi> of his Church,
that he had an <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling to doe good to the Church,
and what ſeuerall conflicts he had in himſelfe before he yelded to
this <hi>extraordinarie</hi> motion or calling from God. Therefore his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9293:17"/>
was, that by the ſayd gentlemans meanes, his gifts and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
might bee tried and allowed by thoſe godly preachers, &amp;c.
What the preachers and others that were conferred with, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Coppinger</hi> herein, and whether more dutifully to the eſtate,
then warily: ſo as they might neither (as they thought) endanger
themſelues, nor kill or diſcourage the zeale of that their brother, in
ſo pretended holy a cauſe, may partly by that which is afore ſpoken
appeare, and wee may then beleeue them when they ſhall tell vs
the whole trueth thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how ſlender and cold diſcouragement he found with ſome
preachers of <hi>London</hi> (with whom hee delt) touching his fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
extraordinarie <hi>calling, and dangerous plots, may alſo appeare
by theſe words found in a letter of his, viz.</hi> Good master L. as maſter
E. former cariage in this action (which ſtandeth me much vpon to deale

               <p>But what reſolution herein was alſo returned from the preachers
of foraine parts to this caſe of conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce propounded by <hi>Coppinger,</hi>
may hereby (not vnprobably) be gathered. <hi>Arthington</hi> at one of
his examinations confeſſed, that <hi>Penrie</hi> ſent a letter vnto him forth
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherin he ſignified, that <hi>Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> (for ſo they ſpeake)
muſt ſhortly be erected in <hi>England:</hi> &amp; herein he ſaid, that he tooke
<hi>Penrie</hi> to be a prophet. Now it is ſure that <hi>Penrie</hi> conueied himſelf
priuilie into <hi>England,</hi> and was lurking about <hi>London,</hi> at the ſelf ſame
time when theſe other <hi>prophets</hi> aroſe in <hi>Chepeſide,</hi> attending (as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
the fulfilling of this his <hi>Propheſie</hi> alſ by their meanes.</p>
               <p>How duetifully and aduiſedly thoſe that be ſubiects haue dealt,
which (hauing intelligence hereof) did conceale it, till it burſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9293:17"/>
forth of it ſelfe, with apparant danger to her Maieſtie and the
whole ſtate may thus be gathered. For by this conceit of <hi>Coppingers</hi>
(you heare) it is pretended and ſurmifed, that a commendable
cauſe, a cauſe to be defended, yea the very trueth of God, (which
muſt preuaile) is by the ſtate ſuppreſſed and kept vnder: that it is
the will of God to haue ſuch a reformation: that impoachment of
it is offered by the <hi>Queene, Counſell</hi> and <hi>Nobles:</hi> that this is a great
ſinne meete to be repented of by them: that they muſt be brought
to this repentance: that the penaltie againſt any of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to be brought, is to be detected as Traytors, an offence deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
death: that this muſt bee done out of hand: that the will of
God (in great fauour for the good of his <hi>Church)</hi> was reuealed to
him in this behalfe, being a man of much faſting, prayer, rare gifts,
a prophet, an <hi>extraordinarie</hi> man, with an <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling;
ſuch as was not to be bee iudged of, or diſcerned by meere ordinarie
men, and whereinto he entred not raſhly or on a ſudden, but after
many conflicts with himſelfe before his yeelding to Gods <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie</hi>
motion and calling: but ſubmitting himſelfe neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
to haue his gifts and calling tryed and allowed of, by the beſt
reformed Preachers, and therefore not worthy to bee ſuſpected, or
diſcredited: that the way to bring them to this repentance was a
ſecret myſterie, ſuch as thoſe preachers and others whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
with (albeit they helde it a worke to bee wiſhed at Gods
hands) yet by his talke gathered the maner of bringing it in, to be
ſo dangerous, as that they feared the ſucceſſe, and refuſed to bee
made accquainted with the particular wayes and meanes, which
hee had plotted to effect it. Thereby making choiſe rather that
<hi>Coppinger</hi> ſhould venture to put it in practiſe (if he remained reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
herein, which they found by him) of what dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
ſoeuer ſuch a way might be, then that they, by bewraying
of him to authoritie, ſhould bee any meanes to breake of and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
his reſolucion, or quench his zeale. And thus (with opinion of
ſafetie to themſelues) they merchandized the haſard of their friends
life, or els the rearing of ſedition in the Realme, with the hope that
ſecretly they nouriſhed, to haue the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> (which they dreame
of) erected.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Coppinger</hi> (remayning ſtill more confirmed and ſelted in
this veyne) by his Pue-fellowe <hi>Wigginton</hi> about <hi>Eaſter</hi> terme laſt
being (as is aforeſayd) brought acquainted with <hi>Hacket</hi> (as with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9293:18"/>
a moſt holy man) ſoone after would needes bring <hi>Arthington</hi> alſo
acquainted with him, as one, whom (vpon ſo ſmall knowledge) he
had obſerued, to bee a very rare man. For this purpoſe hee ſent for
<hi>Arthington</hi> to dinner or ſupper vnto <hi>Lawſons</hi> houſe necre to <hi>Paules</hi>
gate, where <hi>Arthington</hi> met firſt with <hi>Hacket,</hi> together with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom he calleth a godly man: of whoſe ordinary talke then
had, <hi>Arthington</hi> liked very well: but had (as he ſaith) at that time no
further conference with him. After which time, <hi>Arthington</hi> diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
from the Citie, &amp; remained in <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> vntil <hi>Trinitie</hi> terme,
leauing <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi> behinde him, piotting of their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
together: what purpoſes they had, what counſell they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and what conferences they entertained betwixt themſelues and
with others, by the euents enſuing, will beſt bee diſcouered. After
this, <hi>Hacket</hi> ſtayed not long in <hi>London,</hi> but deſired <hi>Coppingor</hi> at his
departure, to write vnto him what ſucceſſe <hi>I. T.</hi> had, &amp; withall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, that whenſoeuer he ſhould write for him, he the ſaid <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
would ſtreight way come vp againe. Hereupon <hi>Coppinger</hi> writte
vnto him firſt at the end of <hi>Eaſter</hi> terme, and after againe very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to be at <hi>London</hi> three dayes before the beginning of <hi>Trinitie</hi>
terme laſt, but he coulde not bee heere ſo ſoone by three or foure
dayes. When he was come, he lodged the firſt night at <hi>Iſlington:</hi> but
ſent his horſe downe againe into the countrey, as purpoſing to ſtay
long in <hi>London.</hi> Then after a night or two (one of which nights hee
lodged at the ſayd <hi>Lawſons</hi> houſe by <hi>Wiggintons</hi> direction) hee was
prouided of a chamber and of his boord at one <hi>Ralfe kates</hi> houſe in
<hi>Knight-rider</hi> ſtreete by <hi>Coppingers</hi> meanes, and at his charges, for he
coſt <hi>Coppinger</hi> there eleuen ſhillings by the weeke: But <hi>Kayes</hi> wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weary of him (in part for that he feared <hi>Hacket</hi> was a coniurer
or witch, in that the Camomill (he ſaith) in his Garden where <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
either trode or ſate, did wither vp the next night, and waxed
blacke) therfore <hi>Coppinger</hi> prouided at his own charges like wiſe an
other roome for him, at one <hi>Walkers</hi> houſe by <hi>Broken wharfe,</hi> where
he remained vntill his apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Hacket</hi> was at <hi>Kayes</hi> houſe, he vſed before &amp; after meales
to pray (as ſeemed) moſt deuoutly and zealouſly, but neuer for the
<hi>Queenes Maieſtie. Hacket</hi> alſo tolde <hi>Kayes,</hi> that if all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
in <hi>England</hi> ſhould pray for raine, if hee ſayde the word, yet it
ſhould not rayne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt of the aforeſayde letters which</hi> Coppinger <hi>writte vnto</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:9293:18"/>
Hacket <hi>to mooue him to come vp, doeth containe matter of note
beſides, not vnfit to be knowen.</hi> Brother Hacket <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
which God hath layde vpon mee (you being the inſtrument to make
me bolde and couragious, where I was fearefull and faint) is greater then
I can beare without your helpe here, though I haue it where you are. The
workings of his holy ſpirite in me ſince your departure, bee mightie and
great: my zeale of ſpirit burneth like fire, ſo that I cannot conteine my
ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conceale his mercies towardes mee. <hi>And a little after in the
ſame letter:</hi> Maſter Thr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is put off till the next tearme, the zealous
preachers (as it is thought) are to be in the Starre Chamber tomorowe,
the Lord by his holy Spirit bee with them: my ſelfe (if I can get in) am
mooued to be there:<note place="margin">Note.</note> and I feare (if ſentence with ſeueritie be giuen) I
ſhall be forced (in the name of the great and fearefull God of heauen) to
proteſt againſt it: my deſire is, that you haſte vp ſo ſoone as you can: your
charges ſhall be borne by mee. <hi>And ſome what after, thus:</hi> If his moſt
holy Spirit direct you to come, come: If not, ſtay: but write with ſpeede,
and conuey your letter and incloſe it in a letter to him, who brought you
and mee acquainted <hi>(vz. Wigginton)</hi> put not your name to it, for
diſcouery: direct your letter thus, To my louing brother in the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giue
theſe my letters: I put to no name, but the matter you know, which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.
Pray that the Lord may reigne, and that his ſubiects may obey:
that all inſtruments whatſoeuer, that ſhall be vſed, may bee furniſhed
with ſuch giftes and graces as euery one haue, or ſhall haue neede of:
that it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may appeare, that the action (now in hand) is his owne: and
therefore he will prouide ſafety for his holy ones, and deſtruction for thoſe
who are veſſels of wrath: who haue accompliſhed the number of their
ſinnes, which call for vengeance from heauen. <hi>Theſe letters</hi> Hacket <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to</hi> Pamplin <hi>ſcholemaſter of</hi> Oundell <hi>to be read vnto him, for
that himſelf could neither write nor reade: but I haue not yet heard
that he complained thereof to any in authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Arthington</hi> alſo about the midſt of <hi>Trinitie</hi> terme laſt was
returned to <hi>London, Coppinger</hi> (hearing therof) came to his lodging,
and then (with many words) extolled and magnified <hi>Hacket</hi> vnto
him, for the holieſtman that euer was, <hi>Chriſt</hi> only excepted, &amp; one
that trauailed (together with him) for the good of the <hi>Queene</hi> &amp; the
land, but after an <hi>extraordinary</hi> maner, and not both by one meanes.
And albeit <hi>Arthington</hi> (as now he ſaith) deſired them to keepe their
ſecrets to themſelues, and not to trouble him with them, (who
had other buſineſſe to attend:) yet <hi>Coppinger</hi> importuned him ſo,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9293:19"/>
as hee coulde not auoyde, but yeelde to heare <hi>Hacket</hi> pray before
them (as a man of a ſingular ſpirit, albeit vtterly vnlearned of the
booke.) The firſt prayer of his (that <hi>Arthington</hi> heard) was about
foure or fiue weekes before their apprehenſion. All which prayers
conceiued by <hi>Hacket</hi> (euen ſince his apprehenſion) the ſayde <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>
prayſed to be ſo diuine, ſweete and heauenly, that thereby
he was drawen into a great admiration of him. In all the praiers that
<hi>Hacket</hi> made in his preſence, <hi>Arthington</hi> obſerued this difference
from other mens: that he vſually therein deſired the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde
him, if he did not ſeeke onely his honour and glorie in all
things: which <hi>Arthington</hi> marking from time to time in him,
and ſeeing him ſtill to be ſo perfitly ſound and very wel, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
drawen (together with <hi>Coppingers</hi> wordes and experience of
him) to recken and eſteeme of him, as of a moſt holy man.</p>
               <p>This leſſon of wiſhing themſelues confounded, his ſayde, two
ſchollers (by imitation) did ſo perfitly learne of him, that to the
great aſtoniſhment and horror of ſuch (that afterward examined
them) they vſed this execration: wiſhing themſelues confounded
and damned, if they ſaid not the trueth, in euery matter whereof
they made any aſſeueration, and wherein they deſired to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
thinking (as <hi>Arthington</hi> confeſſeth) that whatſoeuer the ſpirit
(as he fanſied) tolde him was a trueth, he was bound to binde it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſaluation or damnation. Theſe being ioyned with the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of certaine extreme torments, which <hi>Hacket</hi> had ſignified vnto
them that he ſuffred, not onely outwardly by the inſtigation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
noble and worſhipfull perſons (as he vntruely made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue)
but more grieuouſly a great deale (hee ſayde) by ſuffering
whatſoeuer either Deuils in hell, Sorcerers or Witches in earth,
could practiſe againſt him (all which he pretended to haue endured
for triall and proofe, that the Goſpell was the true Religion againſt
Poperie and all other ſects) did ſo deepely aſtoniſh, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate
them: that (after great faſting and prayer vſed, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
they vſually performed on the Sabboth dayes) they all did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
conclude, that if <hi>Hacket</hi> indured in trueth all theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and practiſes againſt him, for ſo holy an ende, no doubt hee
was a man, which ſhoulde not onely eſtabliſh the Goſpell in all
kingdomes, but all <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> ſhould alſo yeelde their ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
vnto him, and hee ſhoulde bee eſtabliſhed chiefe king ouer all
<hi>Europe.</hi> Reaſoning thus with themſelues, that ſurely the Lord had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9293:19"/>
ſome great good to be done by him that had indured ſo much for
his ſake.</p>
               <p>Nowe, this was the opinion, which to haue firmely planted in
them two (as in deede it was firſt in <hi>Coppinger,</hi> and afterward in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington)</hi>
was the mayne ſcope and drift (as may ſeeme) of all <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets</hi>
cunning counterfaiting of ſo much holineſſe, pietie, zeale and
religion.</p>
               <p>To worke this, he handled his actions ſo warily with them, that
<hi>Coppinger</hi> ſeriouſly once auouched vnto <hi>Arthington,</hi> how himſelfe
had by good experience found, that God would denie vnto <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
nothing which he prayed for or deſired, and namely proteſted,
that <hi>Hacket</hi> begged of God in a drought (that was not long afore
their apprehenſion) a ſhowre of rayne, and that it was preſently
ſent in good aboundance, <hi>Coppinger</hi> alſo ſo firmely beleeued <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi>
that he tolde his owne man <hi>Emerſon,</hi> how <hi>Hacket</hi> being impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
the boltes would (often) fall off his heeles miraculouſly.</p>
               <p>But for proofe that ſuch incredible torments were in deede ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by <hi>Hacket,</hi> he appealed herein to ſome of the Nobilitie, and to
diuers others both of worſhippe and good credite. This did <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
further confirme vnto <hi>Arthington,</hi> ſaying, that Maſter <hi>Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
alſo did iuſtifie the trueth of the torments that <hi>Hacket</hi> ſuffered,
and could doe it with a hundred honeſt witneſſes moe, if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
And <hi>Arthington</hi> himſelfe alſo once heard <hi>Wigginton</hi> pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell, how great and extreme torments <hi>Hacket</hi> had indured.</p>
               <p>But being aſked by them, why hee was ſo tormented, and how
theſe could tend to proue the Goſpel to be the onely true religion?
<hi>Hacket</hi> anſwered them thus: that his tormentors (the better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
their lewde purpoſes and malice) gaue out and ſurmiſed him
to be out of his wits, but the trueth was (ſayde he) that being once
at table with one <hi>G. H.</hi> an obſtinate Papiſt, and reaſoning which
was the true religion (I defending this which we now profeſſe to be
the trueth, againſt <hi>Poperie</hi> and all other ſectes) amongſt other ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
I proteſted vpon my damnation, that this was the trueth, and
withall prayed, that I might ſinke preſently downe into hell, if it
was not ſo: and that, if he the ſaid <hi>G. H.</hi> would ſay ſo much for his
religion, if hee did not ſinke preſently into hell, then would I take
<hi>Poperie</hi> to be the true religion. But he refuſing ſo doe, and being
greatly mooued thereby againſt me, complotted with a Knight (a
neere kinſeman of his) and with another gentleman (being a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9293:20"/>
and with ſundry others, who found ſuch meanes, as that they
procured Deuils to be rayſed, Sorcerers, witches, and Enchaunters
(all which (ſayde hee) I knowe and can name, and minde one day,
to helpe to burne them) to worke vpon my body, with intent to
make mee call backe my ſayde wordes of proteſtation, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the trueth of this religion, which if I would not doe (ſayde
they) but could endure the torments that they would inflict, then
they all would bee of my religion, and would make mee <hi>Emperour</hi>
ouer all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This tale to them that had minds afore prepared, and tooke</hi> Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
<hi>by reaſon of his moſt earneſt proteſtations, prayers, ſhewe of
zeale pretended, fauour with God, and ſuch like, to be a man that
would not tell an vntrueth for all the worlde, ſeemed no way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
or to be diſcredited: ſo that theſe three principall actors
hauing aſwell among themſelues, as with others often conferred
hereabouts (both by word and writing) were by the midſt of</hi> Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<hi>terme become moſt reſolute, for the aduancing of their deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For in a letter written by</hi> Coppinger <hi>(about that time) to the
aforeſaid</hi> I. Thr. <hi>it is thus contained.</hi> Mine owne deare brother, my
ſelfe and my two brethren, who lately were together with you in Knight
ryders ſtreete, doe much deſire conference with you, which will aske ſome
time. The buſineſſe is the Lords owne, and hee doth deale in it himſelfe,
in a ſtrange and extraordinarie maner in poore and ſimple creatures.
Much is done ſince you did ſee vs, which you will reioyce to heare of,
when wee ſhall meete, and therefore I beſeech you (ſo ſoone as you receiue
this letter) haſten an anſwere in writing to my ſiſters houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therein ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe
(I beſeeche you) when I may come to ſpeake with you; for delayes
are dangerous, and ſome of the great enemies beginne to be ſupurſued by
God, as they are at their wits end. The Lordmake vs thankeful for it, who
keepe vs euer to himſelfe, to doe his will and not ours. <hi>By occaſion alſo
of</hi> hearing <hi>Maſter Charke</hi> on a Fryday about that time at the Blacke
fryers, Coppinger <hi>ſaith, he was</hi> thereupon moued by God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpirite to write
vnto him a letter, <hi>which beareth date the 9. day of</hi> Iuly <hi>laſt. In
which letter (amongs other things) thus hee writeth vnto him.</hi>
I doe not denie good Syr, but that I haue nowe (a good long time) taken
a strange and extraordinarie courſe, ſuch as hath offered occaſion of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
of my not onely doing hurt to my ſelfe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but alſo to the beſt ſort of
men now in queſtion, and to the cauſe it ſelfe. But by what warrant I
haue done this, that is all: for if the holy Ghoſt haue bene my warrant,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9293:20"/>
and carryeth mee into ſuch actions, as are differing from others of great
note in the Church of God, what fleſh and blood dare ſpeake against me?
This is it that I deſire at your hands, and at all the rest of Gods ſeruants,
that you forbeare to cenſure me and ſuch others, as ſhall deale extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
with me in the Lords buſines committed to our charge, &amp; iudge of
vs by the effects that followe: which if you hereafter ſee to be wonderfull
great, then are all ordinarie men (placed in callings within this land) to
feare, and to call themſelues to examination before the Iustice ſeate of
God, and ſee whether they haue walked faithfully before God and man,
in ſeeking the ſaluation of the ſoules of the people, and the aduancement
of Christs kingdome,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and the ouerthrowe of Antichristes. And if all
and euery one in their places ſhall be forced to confeſſe, to haue fayled in
not diſcharge of their dueties, let them acknowledge their ſinne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
before plagues and puniſhments fall vpon them. The waſte of the
Church cannot be denyed to be great, ſo that there is place for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
men (though temporizing Christians will not admit this) therefore
Gods mercies ſhall appeare to be wonderfull great, if amongst vs he haue
rayſed vp ſuch, as I knowe hee hath, and hereafter I doubt not (by Gods
grace) but I, with the helpe of the reſt, ſhalbe able to auowe againſt all
gaineſayers whatſoeuer. My deſire heretofore hath bene to haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle
and direction from others: but nowe (by comfortable experience) I
finde that the action (which the Lorde hath drawen me into) is his owne,
and he wil direct it himſelfe by the holy Ghoſt, and haue the full honour of
it, and therefore I wayte vpon him, and yet moſt hartily craue the prayers
of the Saints, that they will beſeech God to bleſſe all his ſeruants, that he
hath ſet aworke in his owne buſineſſe. And I further beſeech you, to ſhewe
this Letter to <hi>Maſter Trauerſe,</hi> and <hi>Maſter Egerton,</hi> and all the rest of
the godly Preachers in the Citie, and iudge charitably of me and others,
and let euery one looke to his owne calling, that therin he may deale faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and let vs iudge our ſelues, &amp; not iudge one another, further then we
haue warrant. <hi>After this letter, it hapned that</hi> M. Charke <hi>preached
in the ſame place againe the next</hi> Sunday <hi>after, at which time</hi> Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger
<hi>tooke him ſelfe to be particularly meant by one part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Whereupon hee wrote a letter to another Preacher (as I doe
gather) the thurſday after viz. 15. of Iuly: wherby he thus ſignifieth.
M. Charke</hi> told the people, that there were ſome perſons ſo deſperate, that
they would willingly thruſt themſelues vpon the rockes of the lande, and
waues of the ſea. This I tooke to be ſpoken principally to my ſelfe, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I thought good to aduertiſe you, that he ſpake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth in thoſe words:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9293:21"/>
but he touched not mee, but himſelfe, and the rest of the miniſters of the
lande, who haue not onely runne deſperately themſelues vpon the rockes
and waues, but carryed the whole ſhippe, whereby they all bee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of ſhipwracke, and ſhoulde haue periſhed, if the Lorde had not
immediatly called three of his ſeruants to helpe to recouer it, who are not
onely ſent from God to his Church here, but alſo elſewhere, through the
worlde. My calling is ſpecially to deale with Magiſtrates. Another hath
to doe with Miniſters, who hath written a letter to you of the Citie, but
it cannot be deliuered hardly this day. The other third is the chiefeſt (who
can neither write nor reade) for he is the Lords Executioner of his moſt
holy will. <hi>This letter is thus ſubſcribed,</hi> The Lords meſſenger of mercy,
Ed. Coppinger.</p>
               <p>Theſe three therefore ſtrongly fanſying to themſelues ſuch <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie</hi>
callings, and ſtanding reſolute by all meanes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
that (which they falſely call <hi>Reformation)</hi> and beeing thus
ſeduced and bemoped by <hi>Hacket,</hi> it is no marueile though they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
further (as by degrees) into many lewde, dangerous, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
attempts.</p>
               <p>For firſt hauing conceaued mortall hatred againſt two great and
and worthie <hi>Counſailors</hi> of this eſtate (who they thought woulde
not a little ſtop the courſe they had taken, and hinder the purpoſe
which they purſued:) <hi>Coppinger</hi> therefore (by <hi>Hackets</hi> aduice) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
ſeuerall letters vnto ſome honourable perſonages, whereby
he ſignified, that certaine treaſons were entended euen againſt her
<hi>Maieſties</hi> owne ſacred perſon: meaning after to appeach thoſe two
thereof: and hoping by this meanes, either to take them away, or at
leaſt their credites with her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> vntill hee and his complices
might bring their purpoſes to ſome better paſſe: or elſe (by this
colourable pretence hauing acceſſe &amp; opportunitie) to haue execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſome wicked practiſe againſt her royall perſon. The diſcouery,
auouching and proofe of theſe ſuppoſed treaſons, <hi>Hacket</hi> and he
did take (eſpecially vpon themſelues.)</p>
               <p>The firſt two letters that (I finde) <hi>Coppinger</hi> writte to the ſayd
honourable perſonages about this pretended matter of treaſon to
be diſcouered, was the third day of Iune laſt: both to this purpoſe,
to haue them acquaint her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> that intelligence was giuen
vnto him of ſome treaſon intended againſt her owne ſacred perſon,
but naming no particular. In the one of them, hee encloſed a letter
of his to her <hi>Maiestie</hi> and certaine petitions, which he would haue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9293:21"/>
had to be offered vp to her highneſſe, being to this effect: That hee
might haue leaue to entertaine the action of ſuch diſcouerie; that
as matters ſhould come to light, he might reſort to a certaine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>Counſellor</hi> (by him there named) to acquaint him therewith,
and to haue his counſell and direction: that hee the ſaide <hi>Coppinger</hi>
might conferre and examine <hi>Ieſuites</hi> and all priſoners (ſuſpected
or condemned of treaſon) about theſe matters, in the preſence of
certaine others: That for better furtherance of his ſeruice, hee
might haue this fauour to ſtay iudgement, or at leaſt execution
againſt condemned perſons for crymes capitall or ſmaller, vntill
her Maieſtie might haue account giuen of the cauſe of his ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
that he might be pardoned for ſo bolde an attempt, if in ouer
much feare of danger to her ſacred perſon, hee had, or afterwarde
ſhould goe too farre, and not effect that in the ende, which hee
hoped to doe: and laſtly, that this matter might bee concealed
from all men. But the ſayde honourable perſonage finding this
to bee an vnlikely and ſtrange courſe to bee yeelded vnto (as may
be gathered by the anſwere, and by the other letters) directed
him to a more ſounde way: viz. To learne firſt the groundes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitely,
to acquaint none other with the matter, and to doe it ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.
Hereupon the eight of the ſayde <hi>Iune,</hi> hee addreſſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
letter to the ſame perſonage, encloſing therein a letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to him from <hi>Hacket,</hi> and dated the laſt day of <hi>May,</hi> and one
other letter of his owne to her Maieſtie, to haue bene deliuered
vnto her Highneſſe. His letter to the ſayde honourable perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
is to commend the writer of that letter encloſed, not naming
him, (for <hi>Coppinger</hi> had raced out both <hi>Hackets</hi> name &amp; the name
of <hi>Oundel</hi> from whence is came) as a man able and willing, to doe
her Maieſtie ſome principall ſeruice, to offer their attendances to
come before her Maieſtie, and to vrge the deliuery of the letters, for
that the matter (he ſaid) admitted no delayes. The letter from <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
is nothing but an inciting and animating of <hi>Coppinger,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the Lordes buſineſſe (he had in hand) by many holy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
words and hypocriticall alluſions to certaine ſtories of the
ſcripture. <hi>Coppinger</hi> his letter to her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> commendeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter
of that incloſed, for a man beloued of God, and fearing him
vnfainedly, and one enabled (by God) to do her highnes ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
ſeruice: he alſo humbly deſireth thereby, that they two might
appeare before here owne Princely perſon, in the preſence onely of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9293:22"/>
two certaine Lordes and one Ladie. But the ſayde honourable
perſonage ſent <hi>Hackets</hi> Letter againe vnto <hi>Coppinger,</hi> as of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for that purpoſe, and ſtayed the deliuery of his Letter to her
<hi>Maiestie,</hi> till ſome particular intelligence might be had, to be firſt
deliuered to her Highneſſe. The ſame day <hi>Coppinger</hi> alſo writ two
ſeuerall Letters to the ſame two Lordes, in whoſe preſence he and
<hi>Hacket</hi> deſired to come before her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and to deliuer their
intelligence; this he did, to aduertiſe them hereof afore hand. That
which is written to the one of them, mentioneth a ſupplication,
which <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſent (the day afore) vnto his L. to make paſſage
to ſome better ſeruice to her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> which he hoped ſhould bee
done ſhortly to her Highneſſe good liking, and to his L. great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for that hee ſhould bee the chiefe actor therein. Vpon ſome
anſwere returned from the Ladie afore mentioned, crauing ſome
particulars of that which they meant to diſcouer, <hi>Coppinger</hi> writte
to <hi>Hacket</hi> (being in London) to vrge him vnto ſome more ſpeciall
poynt of intelligence: whereunto <hi>Hacket</hi> (the ſayde eight of <hi>Iune)</hi>
anſwering by Letter to ſmall purpoſe, and ſubſcribing his Letter
thus, <hi>As you finde mee, ſo call mee: Coppinger</hi> therefore returned in
anſwere another Letter preſently vnto him, whereby he ſignified,
that <hi>Hacket</hi> muſt manifeſt ſomewhat more plainely, of ſome prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
worth the reueiling, otherwiſe they both ſhould worthily fall
into her <hi>Maieſties</hi> indignation: for that which he had then writ,
would not ſatiſfie her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> and the State, concerning the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which <hi>Hacket</hi> ſuppoſed to bee comming vpon the lande, and
wherewith he ſeemed to be acquainted.</p>
               <p>Vpon ſuch ouerture (as afore is touched) made to one of the
ſaid Lords, he had the ſaid two appeachers before him on the tenth
of <hi>Iune:</hi> but finding <hi>Hackets</hi> demeanour of himſelfe very ſtrange,
and their imputations as friuolous, hee diſmiſſed them (as is ſayde)
without further a doe, to their great diſcontentment. Hereupon
<hi>Coppinger</hi> (in ſtomacke ſo farre as he durſt) writte another Letter
to the ſayde Noble man the eleuenth of <hi>Iune:</hi> hereby hee ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that were it not that he had beene before acquainted with
the graces and giftes of the holy Ghoſt, which hee did aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to bee in <hi>Hacket</hi> in an <hi>extraordinarie</hi> manner, hee ſhoulde
haue eſteemed of him (by his behauiour) as his Lordſhippe did.
Therefore what trouble or daunger ſoeuermight come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by it, hee was reſolute to abide it, and further chargeth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9293:22"/>
the ſayde <hi>Noble</hi> man (in Gods name) to deliuer the Letters and
Copies there incloſed to her <hi>Maiestie,</hi> ſignifying, that what
puniſhment ſhoulde in that reſpect bee allotted to him or vnto
<hi>Hacket,</hi> they would vndergoe it, and not depart the Citie, till
they might further vnderſtande, what God would doe therein.
Sure it is, that (being thus ſhaken off by him) they grewe extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
malicious alſo againſt the ſayde worthie Noble man.</p>
               <p>I finde alſo a Copie of a Letter written in <hi>Coppingers</hi> hande,
but meant to bee ſent as from <hi>Hacket,</hi> vnto her excellent <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie:</hi>
wherein (amongs other thinges) hee deſireth hee may
enioy that, which God hath appoynted him, and then lewdely,
and falſely accuſeth and reuileth two great and worthy <hi>Counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</hi>
In the ende hee ſayeth, that <hi>if hee ſhoulde tell her the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of God that lye at her gate (which the Lorde hath ſhewed him)
they woulde bee ouer fearefull for her to endure, or to heare of. And
if ſhee doubted of his ſending from the Lorde, hee willeth her to aske
a ſigne, and if he giue it not, let him dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſeconde courſe taken by them beſides the former appeache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
was a conſpiracie of the death of certaine the Lords of the
<hi>Councell,</hi> when they ſhould bee at the Starre-chamber, in caſe they
ſhould giue any iudgement againſt certaine, that were (ſometime)
Preachers, and are now priſoners for miſdemeanors, perillousto the
peaceable ſtate of the Realme, as is intended. That this deuiliſh
purpoſe was riſe amongs them, may appeare by a letter ſent by <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi>
in <hi>Trinitie</hi> terme laſt, vnto the aforenamed <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> In
which was contayned to this effect, that <hi>if the Lordes ſhould giue
a hard cenſure againſt thoſe parties (the next day) if God ſhewed not
ſuch a fearefull iudgement againſt ſome of thoſe Lordes, as that ſome of
them ſhould not go aliue out of that place, then neuer trust him.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſawe this letter, could not picke any further matter out
of it, then <hi>Coppingers</hi> conceipt, that God (without ſome ſpeedie and
miraculous iudgement from himſelfe alone) would not ſuffer ſuch
men to bee puniſhed: yet <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (to whome it was directed)
iuſtly ſuſpected ſome further meaning, and that the concealing of it
might be both accounted vnduetifull, and further alſo dangerous
vnto him, and therefore asked counſell of ſome more skilfull then
himſelfe, whether hee might ſafely ſuppreſſe it, and teare the letter
in pieces.</p>
               <p>Another deuiſe they alſo had for preparing (as is ſuppoſed)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9293:23"/>
of the mindes of the people, and to ſtirre them vp to be in readines,
which was by certaine ſeditious letters, that were purpoſely ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fiue or ſixe nights afore in many of the ſtreetes of <hi>London,</hi> by
ſome of theſe actors, or by their complices and fauourers. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there was found in <hi>Wiggintons</hi> chamber (in the priſon where
hee remayneth) about a thouſande printed Pamphlets of two
ſortes: the one of <hi>Praedeſtination,</hi> the other carrying an odde and
needeleſſe title to euery man, that knoweth but the Author. For it
is entitled on the firſt ſide, in great letters thus: viz. <hi>The Fooles bolte:</hi>
and immediatly vnder that title, this ſentence is ſet downe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be duely conſidered, with all his circumſtances now appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
viz. <hi>Such as doe ſurmize the complaynt of Innocencie to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
and the report of Trueth to be ſlaunder, ſhall neuer want the due
reward of their groſſe errour, whileſt Innocencie and Trueth ſhall endure.</hi>
On the other ſide of the ſheete the title is, <hi>A fatherly exhortation to a
certaine yong courtier.</hi> The matter thereof is conceiued into an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ryme, rouing lewdly not only at the gouernours Eccleſiaſtical,
and at other Miniſters, but alſo at ſundry hauing ciuil authoritie and
high places. Amongs the reſt, the firſt two ſtaues and laſt ſtaue are
moſt perillous, if ye reſpect the preſent action theſe perſons had in
hand, their opinions of this ſtate, and the baſe condition and ſtate
of the chiefe of them. The firſt are theſe. viz.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>My ſonne if thou a Courtier ſue to bee,</l>
                  <l>In flowre of youth this leſſon learne of mee.</l>
                  <l>A Chriſtian true although he be a clowne,</l>
                  <l>May teach a king to weare ſcepter and crowne.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the laſt
ſtaue are theſe, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>For God will ſure confound ſuch as deuiſe.</l>
                  <l>His ordinance or Church to tyrannize. &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Theſe papers <hi>Wigginton</hi> (by the meanes and helpe of one <hi>Browne)</hi>
procured priuily to be printed at <hi>Whitſontide</hi> laſt, and being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
touching them by her Maieſties Counſell and others, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that they were all to be ſent to women, the weaker veſſels:
viz. to <hi>Miſtreſſ L. Miſtreſſe B.</hi> and to I knowe not how many Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes,
by them to be diſperſed abroade: to the intent, that euery
one (to whom they might come) ſhould conceiue of them, as the
ſpirit ſhould moue them. And <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo confeſſed, that a part of
certaine writings which <hi>Wigginton</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi> framed was, that
<hi>a Clowne might teach a King to weare a Crowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:9293:23"/>
Now that <hi>Wigginton</hi> held intelligence in theſe matters with the
conſpirators, and that there was mutuall and ordinarie correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
betwixt him and them in all plots for aduancing of their
<hi>Diſcipline per fas &amp; nefas</hi> (beſides that which in this behalfe hath
bene touched afore) is made alſo manifeſt, by the confeſſion of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington,</hi>
who ſaith, that about the fifteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> or not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
hee heard <hi>Hacket</hi> ſinging of certaine ſongs, who then wiſhed
that <hi>Arthington</hi> had alſo ſome of them: for it was a very ſpeciall
thing, and (ſaid he) <hi>M. Wigginton</hi> hath a great many of them.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Coppinger</hi> had once conference with <hi>Wigginton</hi> (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of <hi>Arthington)</hi> touching his <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling. At what
time it is pretended, that <hi>Wigginton</hi> refuſed to bee made acquainted
with the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Coppingers ſecrets:</hi> and that he vſed theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to <hi>Coppinger,</hi> vz. <hi>You are knowen to be an honeſt Gentleman, and
ſworne to the Queene, and therefore I will not be acquainted with thoſe
things, which God hath reuealed vnto you for the good of your Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</hi>
And his opinion of ſuch extraordinary callings (ſet downe
vnder his owne hand) doth elſe-where appeare, whereby is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
that he was made a common oracle for ſuch <hi>fantaſtiques:</hi> that
he knewe the matter in generalitie, which by <hi>Coppinger</hi> was to be
wrought vpon the <hi>Queene,</hi> to bring her (forſooth) to repentance,
howſoeuer he refuſed to knowe the particular manner of ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets:
that hee acknowledged it to bee good for the <hi>Queene,</hi> and
yeelded it (without ſcruple) to bee reuealed vnto <hi>Coppinger</hi> from
God, ſo that it could not be, but that <hi>Coppinger</hi> hereby was much
animated to goe forward in his conceiued wickedneſſe. Beſides,
<hi>Wigginton</hi> taketh knowledge (as appeareth by a paper of his owne
hand writing found in his Chamber) that <hi>Hacket</hi> had defaced the
<hi>Queenes armes,</hi> and had vttered dangerous wordes, importing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be a King, and his miſlike of all Kings now raigning, ſince
his laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>London. Hacket</hi> further declared vnto M. <hi>Young</hi>
on the 24. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> that he was once (in companie of two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and of <hi>Miſtris Walker</hi> and <hi>Miſtris Lawſon)</hi> with <hi>Wigginton</hi>
in his Chamber, where and when he heard <hi>Wigginton</hi> ſay, that <hi>if the
Magiſtrates doe not gouerne well, the people might drawe themſelues
together, and to ſee a Reformation.</hi> This dangerous opinion of his,
may bee alſo gathered out of a letter of his owne hande writing
(found with him) being dated the ſixth of <hi>Nouember</hi> laſt, wherein
he thus writeth. <hi>M. Cartwright (ſaith he) is in the Fleete for refuſall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9293:24"/>
of the oath, as I heare, and M. K. is ſent for, and ſundry worthie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are diſquieted who haue bene ſpared long. So that wee looke for
ſome bickering ere long, and then a battaile, which cannot long endure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth purpoſe of theirs, was not onely to make an alteration
in the ſtate of Church-gouernement, and to plant in euery congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
their <hi>Elderſhips</hi> or <hi>Conſiſtorie of Doctor, Paſtor,</hi> and certaine
<hi>laye Elders</hi> with the appurtenances: but alſo to change the Ciuill
policie of this Realme. For which conſideration, they meant to
diſplace all the Lords and others of the priuie Counſell: therefore
(in their ſpeeches and writings touching theſe Counſellors) they
vſed of late no title of honour, but their bare names and ſurnames,
or els their names with this addition: <hi>Late L Ch. or late L. Tr.</hi> as if
they were already diſautoriſed, and in their ſteads they had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and ſet downe, certaine others (in trueth very honorable and
worſhipfull perſons) that ſhould be counſellors, of whome euery
honeſt man neuertheleſſe is perſwaded, that they deteſt both theſe
and all other ſuch vile, ſeditious and fanaticall perſons and courſes.</p>
               <p>Coppinger <hi>(not long afore their riſing as it ſeemeth) penneda let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to haue bene ſent to the one of the aforeſayde honorable perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages.
In this letter he chargeth a great &amp; worthy</hi> Counſellor <hi>(vſing
onely his</hi> Chriſtian <hi>name and ſirname)</hi> that he together with his helliſh
and infernall companions <hi>(for ſo he raueth)</hi> had comitted treaſon in the
hieſt degree againſt her Maieſtie. <hi>He deſireth that honorable perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
to effect, that the ſaid</hi> Counſellor, himſelfe, and two others of the
Lords meſſengers, may be brought before the Queenes Maieſtie: and if
he be not prooued a traitor to God and her, then let me <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> for my
pride and preſumption, be hanged at the Courtgates. <hi>Then he exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
againſt another great Counſellour (terming him but by his
bare name likewiſe) to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſent letters &amp; copies to haue bin

wicked Counſellers,<note place="margin">Note.</note> &amp; vngodly magiſtrats, ſhalbe forced to acknowledge,
what they are worthy to haue: the Lord pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſoules, for in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, they muſt be puniſhed, though they repent: <hi>&amp; a litle after, thus.</hi>
I doe aduiſe alſo that euery one of her Counſell be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to keepe their
houſe or chamber, for feare of ſtirre or danger. <hi>Then he doth appoint to
her</hi> Maieſtie <hi>a new Counſel,</hi> aduiſing that Wigginton (a man in more
fauour <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> with God, then any man of his calling whatſoeuer) be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to be neere her highneſſe, to pray to God, or to preach priuatly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:9293:24"/>
                  <hi>By the like reſolute vaine,</hi> Arthington <hi>alſo chargeth the ſayde</hi>
Counſellor, <hi>as deepely, and vpon the like &amp; greater penaltie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
in a ſupplication penned by him to haue bene ſent to her</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.
<hi>But I will giue you a taſte how friuolouſly, &amp; vpon what fond
proofes he groundeth his accuſation, to the end it may appeare, that
this was but a colourable pretenſe wherein they repoſed to great
ſuretie of ſucceſſe, but hoped at length thereby to haue brought
themſelues and</hi> Hacket, <hi>to her Maieſties preſence. The iſſue he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
is this,</hi> That if in her Maieſties preſence he prooue not the ſaide
Counſellor to be the moſt dangerous enemie that was diſcouered ſince her
highneſſe reigne, then let his body and ſoule be for euer damned: Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alwaies, that if her Maieſtie cannot (by his euidence) iudge him the
ſaid Counſellor to be ſo bad as he makes report of him, yet that ſhe would
giue him the ſaide Arthington leaue in her ſacred Preſence, to fight the
combat of praier with him,<note place="margin">Newe Triall by combat in prayer.</note> wherin, if it pleaſe him <hi>(ſaith Arth.)</hi> I wil firſt
begin to pray againſt my ſelfe, that if he be not as deepely guiltie as I haue
charged him, then that Gods vengeance may preſently conſume me both
body &amp; ſoule into hell for euer, which if it come to paſſe, the victorie ſhalbe
his, &amp; he returne an innocent. But if he ſee me leape vp for ioy, as one that
hath diſcouered him to be a traitor, then if he dare fal down in like ſort, &amp;
make the ſame praier, that the like vengeance may fal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelf, if he be
ſo deepely gilty as I haue charged him, &amp; if Gods vengeance fall not vpon
him before he depart out of her preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let me be hangd, drawn &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
for laboring to empeach a Counſellors credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if he dare not thus
enter the listes with me before her Maieſtie, let him be holden guiltie.</p>
               <p>Their laſt &amp; moſt damnable deſignment of al was the depriuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of her ſacred Maieſty fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her Crown &amp; dignity, &amp; the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of

to the confuſion of all ſeditious wretches her enemies of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>The very particular &amp; principall meanes how theſe diueliſh pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
were meant to be effected by them, <hi>Arthington</hi> now ſaith, that
they were not opened vnto him: pretending that though the other
two ſeemed willing to haue imparted ſome of their ſecretes vnto
him, yet himſelfe was alwayes vn willing to heare any of them. But
for the ſpeciall meanes that <hi>Coppinger</hi> had plotted to bring the
<hi>Q. Maieſtie</hi> &amp; Counſel to repentance, he ſaith that this was a ſecret
myſtery (as <hi>Hacket</hi> &amp; <hi>Coppinger</hi> affirmed to him) which they would
keepe to themſelues, &amp; were ſo enioyned of the Lord. But whether
ſoeuer the way to effect theſe, was ment by ſome open violence,
or ſecret practiſe: ſure it is, that popular tumult was not the leaſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9293:25"/>
meanes they truſted of, to bring them to paſſe, which they hoped
to ſtirre vp by their pretence of ſo great holineſſe, with calling the
Realme to repentance in the open ſtreetes of <hi>London,</hi> by offering
ioyes and mercie to the penitent, and by their Proclamation alſo
then made in <hi>Chepeſide,</hi> as hereafter commeth to be declared.</p>
               <p>Now that theſe their two laſt purpoſes were in deede the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
&amp; maine ends which they propounded to themſelues (beſides
that which by the way is noted already, &amp; that which comes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be mentioned) let theſe fewe proofes enſuing ſuffice. Firſt
for the alteration of the whole gouernment <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the new <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> It is confeſſed, that <hi>Coppinger</hi> &amp; <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
the two counterfeit prophets (on the 16. of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt being <hi>Friday,</hi>
and the ſelfe ſame day that they aroſe in <hi>Cheapeſide)</hi> tolde <hi>Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
in the morning, theſe words amongſt many others: vz. <hi>That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
&amp; the Lords Diſcipline ſhould now forthwith be eſtabliſhed, &amp;
therefore charged</hi> Wigginton <hi>in the Lords name, to put all Chriſtians in
comfort, that they ſhoulde ſee a ioyfull alteration in the ſtate of Church-gouernment
ſhortly.</hi> To which wordes <hi>Wigginton</hi> made no reply nor
further demaund, as of any matter ſtrange vnto him, how it was ſo
ſhortly to be compaſſed. Wherein may alſo be obſerued, that theſe
kinde of perſons doe recken and terme onely thoſe <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> that
will take comfort andioy at ſuch an alteration. So that (by their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions)
it ſkilleth not, what be attempted or done againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
being but as Heathens and Paynims, or at leaſt Idolalaters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus much (with their ſeditious purpoſes alſo) is plainely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in a dangerous letter written by the ſaid</hi> Coppinger <hi>ſince</hi> Eaſter
<hi>laſt, vnto one</hi> Iohn Vdale <hi>a condemned man for Felonie, in the</hi> White
Lyon <hi>in</hi> Surrey, <hi>for writing of the booke termed the</hi> Demonſtration
of Diſcipline: <hi>that letter beginneth thus:</hi> Right reuerend Sir, my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
to viſite you and the reſt of the Saints (who ſuffer for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſake) doe giue you all cauſe to thinke that I haue forſaken my firſt
loue, and haue embraced the God of this world. But my conſcience bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
mee witneſſe of the contrary: the reaſon of mine abſence being ſo
great and ſo weightie, that hereafter when they ſhalbe examined by your
ſelues (who are indued with the ſpirit of wiſdome and diſcerning of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits)
I doubt not but you will allowe of my not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which might bring
you into more trouble and danger, then it would do me good, or breede me
comfort, <hi>And afterward thus,</hi> You haue care &amp; conſcience to further the
building of the Lords houſe which lieth waſte, and to ſeeke the finall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9293:25"/>
of Antichriſts king dome: which being the Lords owne worke, hee
will bleſſe it, and all the actors in it. And this I dare be bold (of mine own
knowledge) to report, that in this great worke he hath diuers that lie hid,
and are yet at libertie, who are hammering their heads, buſying their
braynes, and ſpending their ſpirits in prayers to God, as much as you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you that are in priſon,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and hope in ſhort time to he brought forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſight of their and your enemies, to defend the cauſe you ſtand for.
<hi>And againe afterward in this wiſe:</hi> I beſeech you cheere vp your ſelues
in the Lord, for the day of our redemption is at hand, and pray that the
hand of the Lord may be ſtrengthened in them,<note place="margin">Note.</note> whom he hath appointed
to take part with you in this cauſe, and beſeech him that bleſſing may be
vpon Sion, and confuſion vpon Babel. Pardon my long letter I beſeech
you, and impart mine humble ſute to all the rest, to whom I neither
dare write, nor offer to ſee. I neither put to my name, nor make ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription:
the bringer can report who ſendeth the letter, and let that
ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Furthermore that they hated deadly, and maligned her <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie</hi>
(as a principall obſtacle to their innouation and kingdom, and
therefore ſought to depriue her highnes of her Soueraigntie and
life) may be gathered by their owne words and actions: for <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
confeſſed before the other two, that at a ſermon of one <hi>Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
preaching in the <hi>Blacke Friers</hi> (whither they vſually reſort)
he the ſayd <hi>Hacket</hi> remayned vncouered all the ſermon tyme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the preacher came to pray for her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> but then (hee ſayd)
that hee put on his hat. And when <hi>Arthington</hi> demaunded why
he did ſo, <hi>Copping.</hi> ſtreight way anſwered thus, There is a matter in
that. Likewiſe when as (in their priuate praiers among themſelues)
<hi>Arthington</hi> vſed to pray for the <hi>Queene, Coppinger</hi> would ſundry
times tell him, that his ſo doing did much grieue <hi>Hacket,</hi> adding,
that in the beginning himſelfe did alſo pray for her, but <hi>Hacket</hi>
had now drawen him from it: ſaying, there was a cauſe why,
which <hi>Arthington</hi> knew not, but ſhould know hereafter. For
(ſaieth he) you doe not know this man (meaning <hi>Hacket)</hi> who is
a greater perſon then ſhee, and in deed aboue all the princes in
the world.</p>
               <p>And when as on the very <hi>Sundry</hi> before their riſing (for ſo
themſelues haue ſince termed that action) it hapned that <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
prayed againe for the preſeruation of the <hi>Queenes Maieſtie:
Hacket</hi> (not digeſting this) ſuddenly with indignation turned his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9293:26"/>
face away from him, but when hee prayed for other matters, then
<hi>Hacket</hi> caſt his countenance towardes him agayne: which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
that <hi>Arthington</hi> alſo marked by him, and purpoſing (as
it ſeemeth) to ſalue vp this matter agayne, (leaſt <hi>Arthington</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely
might yet haue fallen from them) therefore when they had
ended their prayers, <hi>Hacket</hi> tooke him with his armes about the
middle (in very kind ſort) affirming, that hee loued the <hi>Queene</hi>
as well as either of them, and deſired him not to bee offended, for
the Lord had commaunded it: adding further, that there was a
matter in it that <hi>Arthington</hi> as yet knew not. Hereupon <hi>Coppinger</hi>
(being in hearing thereof) ſayd, that ſhe might bee prayed for in
generall termes, but not ſo ſpecially as <hi>Arthington</hi> did (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Hacket</hi> was grieued) nor yet to bee prayed for as a <hi>Soueraigne:</hi>
for (ſayd hee) ſhee may not raigne as <hi>Soueraigne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> but this man
<hi>Hacket,</hi> and yet (ſaieth hee) ſhee ſhall liue better then euer
ſhee did, albeit ſhee muſt bee gouerned by another, thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
meaning <hi>Hacket.</hi> And to the intent they might the more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
retaine <hi>Arthington</hi> without ſuſpicion of their poiſonfull
malice (wherein they boyled againſt the <hi>Queenes</hi> highneſſe) <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
himſelfe (once after this time) verie ſubtilly prayed for her
<hi>Maieſtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For proofe that they alſo meant to depriue her of life, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
confeſſions of <hi>Arthington</hi> at ſundrie examinations may bee
alleaged. Whereby (vpon that which hee heard and knew) is
confeſſed, that hee is verilie perſwaded <hi>Hacket</hi> meant her <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie</hi>
ſhould haue bene depriued both of kingdome and life, which
hee alſo gathered by <hi>Coppingers</hi> letters, albeit hee denieth, that
hee was euer made acquainted by what ſpeciall meanes it ſhould
be done.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing in ſome part deſcribed the qualities, perſwaſions
in opinion, familiaritie, inducements vnto mutuall crediting one
of another, exerciſes and deſignments of theſe perſons: it reſteth
to goe on with the narration of the reſt of the action, for better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
vp of this hiſtorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hacket</hi> on a time recounting vp vnto the other two his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(which hee pretended to haue endured) told, how (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others) one <hi>Pigge</hi> a preacher did ſo beate him with rods
at a place in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> (whiles hee lay bound there in a ſinke
hole) that this coſt him the ſayd <hi>Hacket</hi> more deare, then all the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9293:26"/>
reſt of his torments: becauſe thereby hee was enforced to ſuffer
for all hypocrites alſo, adding thereunto, that all their beſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
(ſo they terme ſuch as thirſt after and perſwade innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
were no better in very trueth then <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> neuertheleſſe
hee would (hee ſayd) daily heare them preach. Hereupon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>
tooke occaſion to tell him, that hee could prooue all ſuch
preachers to bee <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> both (albeit of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
becauſe they doe yeeld (in ſome ſort) to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the gouernours, and vnto the lawes of this Church, that
they may be tollerated to preach.</p>
               <p>This pleaſed <hi>Hacket</hi> ſo exceedingly well, as that he beganne
highly to eſteeme of <hi>Arthington,</hi> and hereby the rather he thought
good, that <hi>Arthington</hi> ſhould be made acquainted with their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
For about tenne dayes before their riſing <hi>(Arthington</hi> ſaieth)
that <hi>Coppinger</hi> did greatly importune him to read the letters which
he and <hi>Hacket</hi> had written, if it were but to ſee the ſtile: aſſuring
him they tended to nothing elſe, but to make a way to acquaint
her <hi>Maiestie</hi> with their ſecrets. So that when <hi>Arthington</hi> ſawe
ſo great Counſellors ſo reſolutely thereby charged with matter of
ſo high qualitie, by <hi>Coppinger</hi> eſpecially (her <hi>Maieſties</hi> ſworne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant)
hee was induced to beleeue it, and to thinke they had ſome
very good ground thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arthington</hi> alſo (with great contentment vnto <hi>Hacket)</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
certaine Syllogiſmes, (I beleeue) in a lewd <hi>Moode,</hi> and in an
vnperfect and fond <hi>Figure,</hi> to prooue (forſooth) one of the ſayd
honourable Counſellors (whom hee and <hi>Coppinger</hi> vilanouſlie
afterward proclaimed traitours) to bee ſuch as they doe charge
him to bee. This woorthie worke of <hi>Syllogiſmes</hi> therefore beyng
firſt finiſhed, his other treatiſe (to prooue thoſe preachers to bee
<hi>hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Idolaters)</hi> was ſtraightway ſet vpon the ſtocks, and
began to be built on the Munday before their riſing: after they all
had (for obtaining good ſucceſſe in this and the reſt of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe)
<hi>humbled themſelues on the Lordes day afore in faſting and
prayer,</hi> for ſo bee their woordes. This latter treatiſe <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
finiſhed vp the <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning next after, and termed it
<hi>A Prophecie of Iudgements againſt England,</hi> whoſe ſkill in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
kind of piſtling, the other two ſo magnified, as that they
termed him by a title mentioned in a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> viz. <hi>The pen of a readie
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9293:27"/>
writer.</hi> Where as wiſer men thinke they might haue looked a
litle lower, and he haue better compared it, as the wiſe man doeth
the like, where he ſaieth: <hi>A word in a fooles mouth is like an arrow
in a dogs leg,</hi> becauſe hee will neuer leaue wrinching and fisking,
till he haue got it out.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>propheſie</hi> hee firſt ſetteth downe the third commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Arthingtons propheſie.</note>
inferring what plagues ſhall light on himſelfe if hee offend
therein. Then commeth he to his nine ſeuerall aſſertions, adding
to euery one of them, The Lord to confound him, <hi>viz.</hi> that if he
thinke not himſelfe to bee the vileſt ſinnefull wretch liuing: If hee
take not himſelfe to bee the moſt ignorant in Gods booke of any
man that hath profeſſed the Goſpell ſo long: If hee acknowledge
not himſelfe moſt vnfit and vnwoorthie of all men to ſerue the
Lord Ieſus: If neuertheleſſe he be not extraordinarily called to do
the meſſage of God more faithfully then any preacher in <hi>England</hi>
hitherto hath done: If the Scripture doe not iuſtifie <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
callings before the endes of the world: If hee know not two
perſons within the citie of <hi>London,</hi> that haue greater <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
callings then himſelfe, videlicet, <hi>Edmund Coppinger,</hi> and <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Hacket:</hi> If the former bee not a prophet raiſed vp of the Lord
to bring a meſſage of great Mercie to the land, if all the people
truely repent of their ſinnes: If the later bee not the holieſt man
and of the greateſt power to bring fearefull iudgements vpon the
whole earth, that euer was borne, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> excepted: If the
ſayd <hi>Hacket</hi> (as the Meſſenger of Gods vengeance, where mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is refuſed) doe not bring ſuch great plagues vpon this realme
of <hi>England,</hi> the like whereof was neuer ſeene: In theſe and in
euery of theſe ſeuerall caſes, hee prayeth the Lord to confound
him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he inferreth that hauing thus denounced ſo many
fearefull woes againſt his owne ſoule, as would ſinke it into the
bottomeleſſe pit of hell, if hee were guiltie in any one of them.
Then thereupon with cheerefulneſſe hee commeth to declare
his meſſage to <hi>England,</hi> accuſing it to bee the moſt rebellious,
though it haue bene moſt bleſſed of all other nations. Then he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the citie of <hi>London,</hi> and the courtes of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and the counterfeit worſhip of God with croſſe and ſurpleſſe,
to bee worſe then <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorre,</hi> or the purple whoore of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe deſireth to be confounded. Nay he preferreth <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:9293:27"/>
before <hi>London:</hi> becauſe at <hi>Rome</hi> they ſinne onely of ignoraunce.
Of <hi>her Maiestie</hi> he ſaith, ſhe is leaſt guiltie of the common ſinnes,
but moſt abuſed (of any <hi>Prince</hi> that euer was) by thoſe, whom ſhe
hath moſt aduanced.</p>
               <p>Then he ſpeakes to three great Counſellors, <hi>C. C. T.</hi> daring
them to proteſt for their innocencies againſt themſelues, as deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he hath done, and then, if they be not ſwallowed vp quicke,
he is contented to be hanged vp in chaines at <hi>Paules croſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> Then he
threatneth them, that <hi>they three ſhal be otherwiſe detected ere long, &amp;
all thoſe that are their partakers, when her Maieſtie ſhall reigne and liue
to ſee better daies, if God giue her true repentance.</hi> Then he ſayth he
will leaue all other of the Cleargie (as ſufficiently detected alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
ſaue ſuch as pretend to ſeeke <hi>Reformation,</hi> who (he ſayth) are
as guiltie (in two pointes) as any of the other. The firſt point, for
not crying out continually againſt <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deanes,
Archdeacons,</hi> and others, as wicked vſurpers in the houſe of God.
The ſecond, for not crying out againſt the wicked <hi>Magistrates</hi> of
this land, becauſe they keepe out the <hi>Elderſhips</hi> out of the Church,
and mainteine in their roome, officers and offices of <hi>Antichrist:</hi>
Hereupon gathering thus: <hi>howe can God spare this lande any longer,
wherein both the Magistrates and meſſengers of God haue dealt ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully
in the Lordes ſeruice?</hi> Adding, that <hi>the fearefull iudgements
of God ſhall be ſure to fall on the reprobate: being already prepared, and
put into the handes of the Mightie Meſſenger of the Almightie God,</hi>
William Hacket, <hi>to be powred out vpon this great Citie of London, and
vpon all places, where repentance followeth not this publication.</hi> Then he
goeth about to prooue all ſuch Preachers to be <hi>Idolaters,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> which practiſe or conſent, and ſuffer others to
vſe ſurpleſſe and croſſe, becauſe (he ſayeth) they are the markes
of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Preferring herein the <hi>Papistes</hi> afore them, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
herein onely of ignorance, ſeeking alſo to engreeue their
faultes in this behalfe, for that they are all <hi>hypocriticall Idolaters,</hi> in
that (neuertheleſſe) they profeſſe <hi>Reformation:</hi> whereunto he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
(he ſayeth) a ſecrete: That <hi>this their halting and hypocriſie hath
ſo hardned Gods heart against their requestes, for bringing in the</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
<hi>that for this vnfaithfull and vnſingle walking in their function,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <hi>he hath hitherto denied it. Neither ſhall any one of them, or all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
haue that honour giuen, to bring in Reformation: For</hi> (ſayeth
he) <hi>I tell you truely, the Almightie God hath put his cuppe of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9293:28"/>
into his trustie and faithfull ſeruants hand,</hi> William Hacket, <hi>to
powre it downe ſhortly, vpon euery wilfull and obstinate ſinner that doeth
not repent vpon the notice hereof, or elſe the Lorde confound me.</hi> Laſtly,
he giueth a charge <hi>to haue this Propheſie, together with the incredible,
(but moſt certain) hiſtorie of the holieſt ſeruant of God,</hi> William Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
<hi>that euer hath bene, is, or ſhall be borne, (Chriſt Ieſus onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
with all ſpeede poſſible, printed and publiſhed together, as in ſubſtance
true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or elſe the Lorde confound me.</hi> This wiſe propheſie is
thus ſubſcribed: <hi>By the moſt vnwoorthie ſeruant, but yet a faithfull
Prophet of the Almightie Ieſus, or elſe his wrath confound me.</hi> Henrie
Arthington.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Arthington</hi> was about this his taske, <hi>Coppinger</hi> (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
was neither idle nor well occupied, for he was ſetting down
from <hi>Hackets</hi> owne mouth a long <hi>Ragmans</hi> role, of <hi>Hackets</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
reuelations, and (I knowe not what) called <hi>Hackets</hi> hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
For by <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning <hi>Hacket</hi> hauing enlarged the firſt
draught thereof, (which was at firſt but ſcribled out by <hi>Coppinger)
Arthington</hi> was to write out againe faire the enlarged copie, that
being perfited, it might be annexed vnto the aforeſaid <hi>Propheſie.</hi> All
that <hi>Thurſday</hi> was ſpent by them in conſultation and writing:
<hi>Hacket</hi> being alſo preſent, and aſſiſting them. But with what ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
amongs them all, it is incredible, if wee may beleeue their
owne reportes. Yet <hi>Arthington</hi> was forced (for the haſte that
was made to haue all in readines againſt the <hi>Friday</hi> following, and
for the deſire he had to yeelde vnto <hi>Hacket</hi> all ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
that might be) to ſit vp, moſt of <hi>Thurſday</hi> night, writing
out againe of the ſaid <hi>hiſtorie,</hi> ſo enlarged.</p>
               <p>But on <hi>Thurſday</hi> it ſelfe (being the 15. of <hi>Iuly)</hi> amongs other
their actions: <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> writte a letter to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaide
<hi>T. L.</hi> which is of this tenor: firſt at the top of it, thus: viz.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>If this letter be not endited by the holie Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Coppingers and Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons letter vnto T. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter.</note> who hath appeared (in a
farre greater meaſure) to ſinnefull wretches, in the ende of the
world, euen to vs, whoſe names are here vnder written, and to a
third perſon, in calling aboue all former callings whatſoeuer,
(Chriſt Ieſus excepted) the Lorde confound vs two with venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from heauen, and carry vs (with all violence) into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe
pit.</p>
                     <p>If we haue not taken the name of God in vaine, it ſtandeth you vpon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9293:28"/>
to reade this letter with feare and trembling, with ioy and gladnes: with
feare, that the Lorde ſhould wooe you to doe him ſeruice: with ioy, that he
offereth you honour, if you accept it. We two are meſſengers from heauen,
who haue a good Captaine to guide vs: who haue receaued immediate
callings from God, to call the whole world to repentance, and amendment
of life: otherwiſe they are to feare, that Chriſt Ieſus his ſecond comming
in glorie, will be to them as a thiefe in the night. If I <hi>Edmund Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
doe not preferre you before any one man in the land whatſoeuer, for
your wiſe, holie, louing and religious courſe, both in the generall calling of
a Chriſtian, and in your particular calling, the Lord confound me bodie
and ſoule. The reaſon why I chooſe you firſt, is, becauſe in your houſe, in
your preſence, and (vnder God partly by your meanes) I had my firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
calling, though thereof (as of all other things) the whole
honour and glorie be the Lordes. And of the ſame minde is my brother

Firſt therefore,<note place="margin">A ſumme of Hackets hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> there is declared whom <hi>Hacket</hi> ſerued, then how
he got the execution of the Bailywike of <hi>Oundel,</hi> being void: how
vpon complaint of the wiues there, that their husbands ſpent their
thrift in Alehouſes on the <hi>Sabaoth</hi> daies, he (by a Iuſtice of Peace
not farre off) did cauſe al the playing tables that could be come by,
to be burnt. Alſo the light and entiſing behauiour of ſome women
towards him, &amp; his familiarity with them, wherby his wife became
iealous of him, ſo that he was forced (for her ſatisfaction) to cleare
himſelfe by his oath. The ſundry baites laide by meanes of ſome of
his fellowes (that enuied him for the credit he had with thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſerued) to entrap him with women. His attempting them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
manner, but with purpoſe onely (as he there pretendeth) to
learne of them the practiſes againſt him. The like ſnares laide for
him by ſome of better place &amp; credit, then the former: Of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in minde that he endured, becauſe he ſo behaued himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
women, &amp; yet could not learne out by them, the plot laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. Of his going into <hi>Hampſhire</hi> to haue bene placed there:
Howe he was in a place there (for the moſt part of 20. daies) beat
with a baſtonado, and into what pitifull ſtate of body he was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
brought: That this was done, partly for his auoutching that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> was head of the Church againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and for ſaying, that
as certaine earthen pots were there by him broken, ſo ſhould all
<hi>Papiſtes</hi> be broken in hell, and confounded, ſo many as roſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him in earth: how he was forced to vſe the Deputie-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Hampſhire</hi> his aide, to be ſafely conueied out of that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
leaſt he ſhoulde bee murdered by his enemies: that hee came
thence to one <hi>M. Paul Wentworthes</hi> houſe, where he remained a
moneth, and was vſed moſt Chriſtianly, and where he was moſt
deepely exerciſed in the ſpirite: Howe as he paſſed by the way out
of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> he told a Gentleman in company (that was priuie to
his enemies complots) of a great practiſe intended againſt him,
and to be done in a chamber, by certaine perſons, whome he then
named aforehand: inſomuch as the ſaide Gentleman (being made
priuie to ſuch purpoſe, and knowing that he ſaide true) affirmed,
ſurely he could coniure, or elſe it had not bene poſſible to tell ſuch
things as he did: where in deed (he ſaith) the Lord, in the middeſt
of his former afflictions, reuealed it vnto him, and further ſhewed
him a place which he had appointed for him, and howe he would
bring all his enemies practiſes to confuſion: How in performance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9293:29"/>
of that which was ſo reuealed, he was afterward in a certaine place
in <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> bound, firſt in a chamber, and then chained in a
ſincke hole of a ſeller, and moſt grieuouſly many waies afflicted
there, for 20. daies together: That in the greateſt extremitie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(which was greater then he could expreſſe) a <hi>Croſſe</hi> came vpon
his breaſt as he lay, &amp; alwaies when his torments were at the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
the Lord vnlooſed his feete and handes from his fetters, and
bands: neuertheleſſe he lay ſtil til his tormentors came, and bound
him againe: how the Lord then appeared to him, and aſſured him,
that he would eſtabliſh the Goſpel by him, and ſhewed him all the
whoredome of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the perſon of a great perſonage (ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed)
as it were in candle light, with a great Bell full of iniquitie:
That during that time, the Lorde ſhewed him a terrible famine
which he would bring vpon a lande, but whether this lande or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was not declared: That <hi>Chriſt</hi> then ſhewed him his wiſedome and
prouidence, in gouerning the Seas, &amp; all other waters in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
and further ſhewed him the man that ſhould ſitte on <hi>Chriſtes</hi>
right hand, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, whoſe name he
wel knoweth: That then he made his petition vnto the Lord, who
anſwered him by a voice, thus, <hi>what he would, how he would, &amp; when
he would:</hi> Howe (by the extremitie of his torments) his eies were
fallen downe, and his tongue thruſt out of his head, ſo as he could
not pull it in againe one Barley cornes breadth: but the Lorde in
that extremitie ſhewed him, that hee would keepe his bodie from
burſting, and that one haire of his head ſhoulde not periſh: That
being looſed (by his wiues importunitie) ſoone after, in a verie
raynie daye, hee, his wife, one <hi>Richard Dickons,</hi> and one <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
ridde altogether thence, towarde <hi>Oundell,</hi> thirtie myles that
daye: and albeit it rayned all the daye verie ſore (ſo that great
floods came vpon it) yet neuer one of them had any droppe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
fall vpon their clothes: That being at <hi>Oundell,</hi> and foreſeeing
he ſhoulde bee exerciſed againe, he prayed his wife, that no man
might come at him, for hee woulde keepe his chamber: and then
the Lorde appeared vnto him, and ſhewed him, in what danger
the lande was, by reaſon of forreine enemies at the Sea: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him to goe rounde about the Towne, and that ſhoulde
be a defence to the land round about: That after this, he kept him
ſelfe in his Barne about eight daies, reaſoning with the Lorde, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Praedestination</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> continually begging of him,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9293:30"/>
that hee would ſaue all thoſe, that fought ignorantly againſt the
trueth, or otherwiſe ſinned through want of knowledge: How (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this,) betaking himſelfe to his chamber againe, the Lord (he
ſaith) forced him to cry out againſt two great ſubiects and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors</hi>
in this lande: That he was againe bounde and tormented
there other twentie dayes, in eight whereof, he neither did eate nor
drinke, and was continually watched, for that they knew, the Lord
would come and looſe him, if they left him: That during this time
Witches vſed their forcerie ſtongly vpon him: That the Lorde
then tolde him that he would harden his owne heart againſt <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets</hi>
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tors: How then alſo 4. or 5. Angels night by night ſtood
by him, and watched ouer him, like vnto doues, and one night ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
innumerable: and that a white hande came from the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and tooke him by the hande, whereby all venome, poiſon, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes,
and corruption departed from him for a time: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Lorde ſhewed him three heauens together, &amp; all the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
places contriued in one of them, but the higheſt heauen was
ſhewed to be without ende, which glorie he was not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,
but was made able to looke vpon the blood of the Saintes,
which was made round like a waxe cake, in very great breadth, but
the glorie which therewith appeared, he could not looke vpon, ſo
that he was forced to turne his face vpon the pillowe: Howe the
Lord alſo ſhewed him the murthering of the wicked, euen like the
ſlaying of ſwine, the father murthering the ſonne, and the mother
the daughter, and euery one another, all the day long, and no man
tooke pitie vpon them: That there was then reuealed vnto him, a
very ſtrange fire from heauen, the length whereof he did ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
all things from the heauen to hell mouth, but he did not
ſee the breadth thereof: Alſo that he then did ſee the breadth of
the tormenting place of the damned, and what was therein, but
neither the bottome, nor length of the place: That he alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
he ſawe his libertie begged, by two honourable perſonages:
Notwithſtanding which deliuerance (that he dreamed of) he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
that he was carried afterward to <hi>North-hampton</hi> gaole, where
he remained 17. weekes, as afore is remembred. Furthermore there
is declared, that in his torments the Lorde ſhewed him, howe he
would confound all his aduerſaries that were guiltie in any prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
againſt him, and that one thing which they went about, they
ſhould neuer bring to paſſe: for he let him ſee, that they were all as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9293:30"/>
drunken men and fooles without wit: That in the end they ſhould
throw all their bookes away, and be at a great confuſion, one with
another: That afterward (viz. about the beginning of <hi>Eaſter</hi> terme
laſt) the Lorde brought him to <hi>London,</hi> and howe he was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Coppinger</hi> at that time, as hath bene afore declared:
Howe after his departing out of the Citie from <hi>Coppinger,</hi> he could
not but remember him in his praiers: deſiring the Lord to reueale
himſelfe <hi>extraordinarily</hi> to him, ſo <hi>that he might be encouraged</hi> to
goe forwarde in the action: whereupon (as the ſaide <hi>Coppinger</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed)
<hi>he had two extraordinarie ſeales in very ſhort space after</hi> Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
<hi>departure, and was wonderfully ſtrengthened, to proceede in the
cauſe.</hi> Then is tolde howe the Lorde commanded him to goe from
one place to another in and about the Citie, for two daies ſpace:
and howe he was commanded to raile againſt the ſaide two great
<hi>Counſellors,</hi> in diuerſe places where he came: Howe being (in that
time) commanded to ſee the Lyons in the Tower, he tooke the
fierceſt of them by the head, and had none harme: Then is tolde,
what Preachers in the Citie he heard, and that going to heare one,
he ſawe a ſurpleſſe lie in the Church, whereupon he would not
ſtay there: That he went to certaine Preachers in priſon, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to deale faithfully in the Lordes buſines: And how he
was commanded by God to deface the Armes of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Kaies</hi>
houſe in <hi>Knight-Rider ſtreete.</hi> Laſtly, it is ſaide, that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
two others to deale for, and with <hi>Hacket,</hi> whome it will
ſtand vpon to deale faithfully for the Lorde, for they knowe what
<hi>Hacket</hi> is, and what ſhall followe, if their counſels and directions
be not followed.</p>
               <p>Nowe if any ſhall meruaile, howe ſuch an abſurd and ridiculous
lying legend, ſhould ſeduce men of any conſideration, ſo earneſt
for a ſuppoſed <hi>Reformation,</hi> and ſo exerciſed in praying and faſting:
let him remember, not onely the effectuall, but the efficacie it ſelfe
of Illuſion, and the ſpirite of ſlumber, falling (by Gods ſecrete, yet
alwaies iuſt iudgement) vpon the children of diſobedience, ſuch
as be wiſe in their owne conceites, and not wiſe with ſobrietie:
that they might beleeue lyes, becauſe they haue not beleeued the
trueth: and that they might aske and not obtaine, becauſe they
aske not as they ought.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Arthington</hi> (on <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning) had ended his afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Treatiſe of propheſie (being the very day before their riſing)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9293:31"/>
                  <hi>Coppinger</hi> tolde him, that God (the night before) had enlightned
him the ſaid <hi>Coppinger,</hi> who they all three were, ſaying, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>
had vnawares propheſied truely: for he was the greateſt
<hi>Prophet of Gods iudgements</hi> againſt the whole world, that euer was,
but that they both were greater then he: for <hi>Coppinger</hi> himſelfe
was (he ſaid) the greateſt that euer was, and laſt <hi>Prophet of mercie:</hi>
and that he muſt deſcribe the newe and holie <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> with the
ſeuerall places of ioy, that the elect ſhould enioy after this life, and
that they the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi> were ordained to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Lambes from the Goates, before the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> at the laſt
day. Whereat (it is ſaide) they were both aſtoniſhed, conſidering
their owne vnwoorthines and vnfitnes, crying out againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and their ſinnes: yet ſubmitting themſelues to the direction
of Gods ſpirite, which they were aſſured, ſhould ſufficiently furniſh
them to doe him that ſeruice, which himſelfe did command. Then
<hi>Coppinger</hi> proceeded to tell further, that <hi>Hacket</hi> was greater then
either of them, and that they two muſt obey him, in whatſoeuer he
commanded, but told not then, what nor howe great he was, other
then king of <hi>Europe:</hi> which title was (afore this time) concluded
of amongs them. Hereupon (according to <hi>Coppingers</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<hi>Arthington</hi> offered to honour <hi>Hacket</hi> with his title of the
king of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to demeane himſelfe toward him accordingly.
But <hi>Hacket</hi> himſelf herein diſpenſed with him, vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time ſhould
come, that he was to honour him before others, bidding him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to be of good cheere: for (ſaith he) <hi>I ſerue a good Captaine, who
makes ſo deare accompt of me, that all the diuels in hel, nor men in earth,
cannot take my life from me.</hi> Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> (for confirmation of the
like vnto them two alſo) ſaide, that <hi>Arthington</hi> and himſelfe were
poſſeſſed, not onely with propheticall, but alſo with <hi>Angelicall</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which <hi>Arthington</hi> taking to be true (by a great burning that he
felt in himſelfe after that time) did therupon fanſie to himſelfe, that
no power in earth nor hell, could hurt either of them, becauſe they
had the ſpirite of <hi>Angels,</hi> and they were ſubiect to no power, but to
God alone: And that (God being the maſter of the whole worke)
all things ſhould proſper with them, they onely ſeeking his glory,
which (he ſaith) he vowed with himſelfe, &amp; to deale throughly in
his office, to rebuke the world of ſinne, &amp; to denounce iudgements
againſt whomſoeuer the ſpirit ſhould moue him, without feare or
fauour of men, or of diuels in hel: which ſpirit (he ſaith) then mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9293:31"/>
him (according to his hatred afore conceiued againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and
his opinion that they were traitors againſt the <hi>Queenes Maiestie)</hi>
to vtter and to declare his deteſtation he had againſt the aforeſayd
three woorthie <hi>Counſellors,</hi> being by their places the greateſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
in the land. But herein may be ſaid with the Poet: <hi>Quis tulerit
Gracchos de ſeditione querentes? Verrem de furto?</hi> who can with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
patience indure ſuch ſeditious companions as theſe, to appeach
others of treaſon? but eſpecially, ſo loiall, honourable, and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Counſellors, as they three are knowen to the world to be.</p>
               <p>By the way we may note the ſubtill managing and cariage of
this action by <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi> in this one principall point,
which <hi>Arthington</hi> himſelfe alſo now obſerueth: <hi>videlicet,</hi> in that
they opened not at any time <hi>Hackets</hi> chiefe pretended office vnto
<hi>Arthington: videlicet,</hi> to repreſent and to participate with <hi>Ieſus
Chriſtes</hi> office (of ſeuering with his fanne the good from the bad)
vntill the very time they were to goe into the ſtreetes to doe the
meſſage that <hi>Hacket</hi> enioyned them. For hereby they preuented
a doubt of driuing <hi>Arthington</hi> backe, who ſeemed a man ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable
for their purpoſe, as that hee was woorthie to bee ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by them: and the rather, for that hee had not yet finiſhed
the writing vp of <hi>Hackets historie</hi> (that was to bee annexed to the
<hi>Propheſie)</hi> vntill late that <hi>Thurſday</hi> night which was afore their
riſing, for they might haue feared (if leiſure had ſerued him
to haue conſidered of it, and examined it at full how this could
be) leaſt it might haue made him at leaſt to ſtagger, and be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>Hacket</hi> kept (as <hi>Arthington</hi> now gathereth) that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
wholy to himſelfe to proclaime it to them both together, as
it were by a voyce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, at that very inſtant whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould
receiue their charge of him: and thereby haue no time to reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, being ſtraight way to go forward as obedient perſons to
him in all things.</p>
               <p>Thus that <hi>Thurſday</hi> paſſed on. On <hi>Friday</hi> morning, <hi>Coppinger</hi>
ſent his man <hi>Emerſon</hi> (by fiue of the clocke in the morning) vnto
<hi>Arthingtons</hi> lodging, but his wife would not then awake him: ſo
he ſent for him againe at ſixe, and they two then went together
vnto <hi>Coppinger.</hi> Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> determined (that
Friday morning beyng the 16. day of <hi>Iulie</hi> laſt) betwixt ſixe and
ſeuen of the clocke in the forenoone, to go vnto a certaine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9293:32"/>
mans houſe about the Citie, of good behauiour, and they forſooth
to honour him, to be chiefe Gouernour vnder her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> which
they alſo did that Morning, and promiſed vnto him accordingly
that he ſhould ſo be. Leauing alſo with him both the ſayd <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi>
and <hi>Hackets historie</hi> to peruſe, but the good gentleman was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to deale either with them or their papers any way. They
ſtaied not there aboue halfe an houre. From thence they came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
8. and 9. of the clocke in the morning vnto <hi>Wiggintons</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
(being priſoner in the <hi>Counter in Woodſtreete)</hi> with whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
much ſpeech and conference (part whereof is touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
among other things, they ſignified vnto him, (as <hi>Arthington</hi>
confeſſeth) <hi>that they were prouoked to pronounce him the holieſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of all others, for dealing ſo plainly and reſolutely in Gods cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all miniſters, which God would manifeſt one day to his comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wigginton</hi> at his examination confeſſeth ſuch conference by
him at that time to haue bene had with them, and (as hee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
by thoſe who examined him) hath reported it by writing
ſomewhat largely. He therein alſo ſetteth down a conference had
by him about the ſame matters with <hi>Hacket</hi> himſelfe, comming to
him thither alone (as he ſaith) the ſelfe ſame <hi>Friday</hi> morning, ſome
while after the other two were departed from him.</p>
               <p>It may be gathered by his owne narration, that betwixt the time
of <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthingtons</hi> talke with him, <hi>Wigginton</hi> had ſet
downe article-wiſe, and diſtincted with number the ſeuerall heads
of their ſpeeches had with him. And after he alſo enquired and ſet
downe in writing <hi>Hackets</hi> opinion likewiſe, vnto euery of the ſayd
articles ſeuerally. And albeit it need not bee queſtioned, but that
both for circumſtance and matter he would ſet it downe, the leaſt
that might bee either to his owne, or any his complices diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
yet may it ſerue for the fuller vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for neceſſarie obſeruation beſides, to touch ſome chiefe
points of thoſe conferences, though it be but as himſelf telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

the 16. day of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the morning, 1591.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaieh, that</hi> Coppinger and Arthington came vnto him about 8.
or 9. of the clock of the 16. day of Iuly in the morning, full of courage and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9293:32"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> Hacket <hi>came not long after their departure that morning

beſt) a dialogue had with <hi>Coppinger</hi> &amp; <hi>Arthington</hi> at that time not
worth the inſertinghere: yet this may bee obſerued in it, that they
then ſayd <hi>they would prooue the things aforeſayd, by Gods Spirit (which
was aboue his word) and by his word alſo.</hi> Secondly, by <hi>Wigginton</hi> his
owne report it appeareth, that they anſwered vnto his ſpeeches,
very temperately, directly, and pertinently. Thirdly it appeareth
alſo therein, that he did not contradict any of their ſayings, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
them, nor founde fault with the abſurditie and blaſphemie of
their opinions, and vnduetifulneſſe of their ſpeeches, or danger of

whether hee allowed them to bee ſuch <hi>extraordinarie</hi> men or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his ſayde Narration hee further ſheweth, that hee asking</hi>

bene with him that Morning whiles he lay in his bed, and had ſuddenly
departed from him with one crie, ſaying, Chriſt is come, Chriſt is come
whereat he ſaid he marueiled, not knowing what was their meaning in
the matter: <hi>adding further, that</hi> he had oft warned <hi>Coppinger</hi> to take
heede of conceiuing too much liking of his owne ſpirituall gifts,<note place="margin">Scilicet.</note> whom
he perceiued to bee rauiſhed with an exceeding loue, and extraordinarie
care for the ſafetie of his Miſtreſſe, meaning the Queenes Maieſtie,

all other Preachers ſhall bee damned, vnleſſe ſhee for her part, and you

further, that</hi> Hacket <hi>either at that time, or not long before,</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
him to deale faithfully in the Lordes buſineſſe, <hi>and that</hi> hee had
heard <hi>Hacket</hi> pray ſometimes before, in ſtrange tearmes, as theſe and
ſuch like, <hi>viz.</hi> Father, I knowe thou loueſt me aſwell as thou loueſt thine

touching</hi> Coppingers <hi>and</hi> Arthingtons <hi>ſpeeches (as is afore ſet
downe)</hi> hee ſayde hee woulde depart home into tbe Countrey, yet hee
woulde leaue worde behinde, for his aduerſaries to knowe in what place
they ſhould find him, if they were diſpoſed to cal for him. And withal
made great ſhew (after his former wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted maner) as thogh he neither fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Magiſtrate, nor cared for any puniſhment, nor doubted any danger to
enſue vpon him, for any thing he had done or ſayd, or ſhould goe about.</p>
               <p>Nowe touching ſome things markable in this Narration of
<hi>Wiggintons.</hi> Firſt, if <hi>Arthington</hi> ſay true in his confeſſions: that
<hi>Hacket</hi> publiſhed not himſelfe to haue that office of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9293:34"/>
principall ſpirit, till the very moment that they were to go into the
Citie to proclayme (as they did) and if they went not vnto <hi>Hacket</hi>
that day till they had firſt beene with <hi>Wigginton,</hi> which ſeemeth to
be true: then could it not bee, that <hi>Wigginton</hi> heard that of them
two at that time, which hee reporteth them to haue ſpoken in the
firſt, ſecond, third, &amp; fourth article: and therefore he was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, before that time. Secondly, that, which he maketh
<hi>Hacket</hi> to fumble about ſomewhat doubtfully in anſwere to the
fourth article (touching the olde Magiſtrates that were gone, and
of newe) doth argue, that <hi>Wigginton</hi> was alſo made priuie to the
intent of diſplacing all the olde Counſellers, and placing of newe,
as was plotted by the conſpirators. Thirdly, their lewde and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepart
imputation of her <hi>Maieſties</hi> Honour to bee blemiſhed, and
affirming ſhee was vndone, though it had bene no more, were
matters of that qualitie, that no duetifull or well aduiſed ſubiect
woulde haue either concealed, or ſo lightly paſſed ouer as hee did.
Fourthly, it is probable, that <hi>Hacket</hi> meant rather to haue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks
turned into ſpeares then contrariwiſe: for I ſee no peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
meanes that was thought on by them. Fiftly, wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
that here is a Reformation mooued, which vpon paine of
damnation muſt bee vndertaken, and that with all ſpeede, euen
<hi>Nowe,</hi> (they ſay) wherein others beſide the <hi>Queene</hi> haue their
partes to perfourme in erecting off it: ſome whereof haue alſo
<hi>extraordinarie</hi> giftes and callings to runne in that courſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
and <hi>Wigginton</hi> (being yet a priſoner, but belike put in
hope of ſpeedie deliueraunce by their meanes) is appoynted a
principall aſſiſtant to them: yea, and is made priuie vnto ſome
matter, for which <hi>Hacket</hi> thought he was not vnlike to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
ſought for, and which hee knewe might bee dangerous
vnto him, had hee bene ſuch a man, as any Magiſtrate, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or danger might haue diſmayed, and yet not ſought to bee
reuealed by <hi>Wigginton</hi> vnto any Magiſtrate, till vpon his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
it was founde out. Laſtly, I obſerue the <hi>Coggerie</hi> of the
Reporter, or elſe the lewde lying and contradiction to himſelfe
of that wretched ſeducer <hi>Hacket.</hi> For in his anſwere to the fift and
ſixt articles hee knowes no degrees of glorie in heauen, and
yet in his anſwere to the eight, hee aſſigneth more honour and
higher places in heauen vnto ſome fewe that <hi>are the moſt forward,</hi>
then he doth vnto others.</p>

But let vs goe on with the Narration of the principall action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by occaſion of the conferences had with <hi>Wigginton,</hi> and
of his report of them.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Wiggintons</hi> lodging the ſayde <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi>
came directly to <hi>Hackets</hi> chamber in <hi>Walkers</hi> houſe at <hi>Broken
Wharfe,</hi> and there found the beaſt in bed after eight of the clocke:
where being enflamed (they ſay) with zeale out of all meaſure,
<hi>Coppinger</hi> began to pray at the beds feete, and <hi>Arthington</hi> ioyned
with him: wherein they ſtoode much vpon their owne vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
&amp;c. but yet offered their obedience to doe as the Lord ſhould
direct them by his Spirit, hauing already done ſo much as was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
them. Whereupon <hi>Hacket</hi> came out of his bed, and prayed
with them in his ſhirt twiſe, that the ſpirit might direct them, and
they likewiſe obey the ſame in all things, to the glorie of God
onely. After <hi>Hackets</hi> latter prayer, <hi>Coppinger</hi> offered to goe on in
his prayer, but the Deuiliſh ſpirite mooued <hi>Arthington</hi> to interrupt
him, and to charge him in the Name of the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> to ariſe and
annoynt the king, with the holy Ghoſt. Whereupon <hi>Coppinger</hi>
ſtreightway roſe vp, and three times kiſſed the boordes vnder his
feete, riſing vp after euery time, and making great reuerence with
bowed knee: and after the third time he came towards <hi>Hacket</hi> as
he lay in his bed, who put out his hand, and tooke <hi>Coppinger</hi> by the
hand,<note place="margin">Blaſphemie.</note> and ſayde, <hi>You ſhall not neede to annoynt mee, for I haue bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
annoynted in heauen, by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe.</hi> Then <hi>Coppinger</hi>
asked him, what his pleaſure was to be done. <hi>Goe your way both</hi> (ſaid
he as <hi>Arthington</hi> reports) <hi>and tell them in the Citie, that Chriſt Ieſus is
come with his Fanne in his hand to iudge the earth. And if any man aske
you where he is, tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he lies at</hi> Walkers <hi>houſe by</hi> Broken Wharfe: <hi>&amp;


if they will not beleeue it, let them come &amp; kill me, if they can: for as truely
as Chriſt Ieſus is in Heauen, ſo truely is he come to iudge the world.</hi> Then
<hi>Coppinger</hi> ſaide it ſhoulde be done forthwith: and thereupon went
forward, and <hi>Arthington</hi> followed ſo readily the ſayde <hi>Prophet of
Mercie,</hi> that hee had no leaſure to take his gloues with him, and
yer <hi>Arthington</hi> coulde get downe the ſtayres, <hi>Coppinger</hi> had
begunne (in the houſe below) to proclaime newes from heauen,
of exceeding great mercie: that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> was come &amp;c.
as aboue is ſayde, with whome <hi>Arthington</hi> alſo cryed the ſame
wordes aloude, following him along the ſtreetes from thence
by <hi>Watling ſtreete</hi> and <hi>Olde Change,</hi> towards <hi>Cheapeſide,</hi> they both
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9293:35"/>
adding beyond their Commiſſion theſe wordes, <hi>Repent England,
Repent.</hi> But ſurely either their Commiſſion was deliuered them (at
one time or other) more largely then the one of them now repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
or elſe they went beyond and exceeded it in many other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
poynts beſides this. For after they both had thus come (with
mightie concourſe of the common multitude as to ſuch a noueltie
of hearing two new prophets in theſe dayes ariſen was likely) with
an vniforme crye into <hi>Chepeſide</hi> neere vnto the croſſe: and there fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the throng and preaſſe of people to encreaſe about them, in
ſuch ſort as that they could not well paſſe further, nor bee coueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
heard of them all, as they deſired; therefore they got them vp
into an emptie cart which ſtoode there, and out of that choiſe pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
(for ſuch a purpoſe) made their lewde and trayterous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto the people: wherein they ſtoode not onely vpon the
wordes of their former crye, but (ſo neere as I could learne from ſo
common an Auditorie, and in ſo confuſed an action) they reading
ſomething out of a paper, went more particularly ouer the office
and calling of <hi>Hacket:</hi> how he repreſented <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by partaking a
part of his glorified body: by his principall ſpirit, and by the office
of ſeuering the good from the bad with his fanne in his hande, and
of eſtabliſhing the Goſpell in <hi>Europe</hi> (which as it ſeemeth they
tooke to be all the world, or elſe ſuppoſed, that all <hi>Europe</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<hi>Chriſtianitie)</hi> and of bringing in that <hi>Diſcipline</hi> which they ſo
often bable of, and which they meane by the terme of <hi>Reformation
and the holy cauſe:</hi> that he was now come, and all theſe things were
preſently to be performed by him, telling alſo the people, where
they ſaw him, where he lay and remained: that they were two <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
the one of <hi>Mercy,</hi> the other of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> ſent and <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi>
called by God to aſſiſt him in this great worke, and were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of theſe things: confirming the ſame vpon their owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and wiſhing themſelues confounded and damned for euer, if
theſe things they ſpoke, were not true. And thereupon, the one of
them pronounced <hi>Mercy,</hi> great comfort, and vnſpeakeable ioyes
to all that ſhould repent preſently, be obedient, and embrace this
acceptable meſſage and opportunitie offered: and the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
terrible <hi>Iudgements,</hi> if they repented not, which ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
preſently (alſo) fall vpon them, and eſpecially vpon that Citie
of <hi>London:</hi> affirming that all that beleeued them not, were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
body and ſoule. This iudgement againſt <hi>London</hi> (as <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:9293:36"/>
the pretended <hi>Prophet</hi> of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> ſayth hee gathered out of
<hi>Hackets historie)</hi> was, that men ſhould (there) kill and maſſacre one
another (as Butchers doe kill ſwyne) all the day long, and no man
ſhoulde take compaſſion of them. There was then and there fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deliuered by them, or by the one of them, that <hi>Hacket</hi> was
King of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſo ought to be obeyed and taken: and that all
Kings muſt holde of him, and that the <hi>Queenes Maieſtie</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faited
her Crowne, and was worthie to be depriued. Which moſt
trayterous poynt (amongs others) <hi>Hacket</hi> enioyned them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
as in the one of his Inditements is contayned. Laſtly, in very
vnmannerly and ſawcy tearmes they prayed to God, to confound
two great Lordes of her Maieſties Counſell: for theſe two (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a certayne Knight) they then and there openly and moſt
lewdely accuſed in generall tearmes of treaſon. This outrage was
done the ſixeteenth day of <hi>Iuly</hi> aforeſayde, about ten of the clocke

               <p>By which their proclamation, beeing layde together with their
former conferences, Letters, and purpoſes againſt the <hi>Queene</hi> and

with the very time (when ſo many ſouldiers were about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
it is euident to any, who hath but halfe an eye to ſee with,
that they intended and hoped to moue tumult and ſedition: that
by many handes of the common multitude (which they bragge

brought all their purpoſes at length to a ſure and ſpeedie conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

purpoſe and expectation: his Name be alwayes prayſed therefore.</p>
               <p>And whereas they had purpoſed to haue gone with the like

the preaſſe (not of Officers to take them, but of common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to gaze and woonder at them) was ſo great, as that they
were forced to goe into a Tauerne in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> at the ſigne of the
<hi>Mermayde:</hi> the rather, becauſe a Gentleman in a white doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
beeing of his acquaintance, plucked at <hi>Coppinger</hi> whiles hee
was in the Carte, and rebuked him for his ſtrange and lewde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9293:36"/>
and ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>Whereupon (though <hi>Arthington</hi> were offended with the
ſayde Gentleman for touching a Prophet of God in ſo rough a
ſorte as hee ſayde) yet they were both contented to ſteppe aſide
into the ſayde Tauerne with him: where when they had remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a ſpace, <hi>Coppinger</hi> was perſwaded by one of the aforeſayde
<hi>Lawſons</hi> men, that ſtayed there at that time (for auoyding the
wondering and preaſſe of the people) to ſteppe ouer into <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreete,</hi>
and from thence by backe Lanes to his ſiſters houſe
neere vnto <hi>Powles wharfe,</hi> where hee lodged. But whiles they
two were going together, <hi>Coppinger</hi> was very carefull to know,
whether <hi>Arthington</hi> followed them or not: inſomuch as hee
woulde not bee ſatiſfied, till the ſayde apprentice went backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
for him. At whoſe comming backe, hee found <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
ſtill publiſhing his foreſayde meſſages to the people, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them of <hi>Hacket</hi> and of his Office, with whome <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was content alſo at laſt to goe by the ſame ſtreetes that <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi>
had gone, but yet crying (as hee did afore) <hi>Repent Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
Repent &amp;c.</hi> When in this ſorte they two were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Coppingers</hi> lodging, they founde the gates ſhutte againſt
them: whereupon the ſayde apprentice would haue had <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to haue gone to his owne lodging, but he would needes goe to
<hi>Walkers</hi> houſe at <hi>Broken wharfe,</hi> where not long before he left <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</hi>
All the way that <hi>Arthington</hi> went, hee was followed by a great
multitude of lads and young perſons of the meaner ſort: But at his
comming to <hi>Walkers</hi> houſe, <hi>Hacket</hi> was not yet returned out of the
citie, from <hi>Wigginton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that <hi>Arthington</hi> was entred the houſe, he was there ſtayed
by one <hi>Edward Iones</hi> an honeſt citizen: and when <hi>Hacket</hi> (not long
after) came in, <hi>Arthington</hi> ſaid, There co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the king of the earth.
But <hi>Hacket</hi> willed him to keepe ſilence, telling him he was too out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious:
whereupon hee ſtraightway (in very duetifull manner)
obeyed: for he called <hi>Hacket</hi> his Captayne, and ſayde, That hee
would doe whatſoeuer he commaunded him to doe.</p>
               <p>When the ſaide <hi>Iones</hi> (in ſearching about <hi>Arthington)</hi> found
a writing in his ſleeue, <hi>Arthington</hi> ſayde, That fell out as hee
would haue it, for now it would be ſeene: for he had made (he ſaid)
an Epiſtle to the <hi>Queene,</hi> and ſhee woulde not receiue it, and
therefore ſhee was (hee ſayde) no longer <hi>Queene,</hi> but was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9293:37"/>
depryued of her Crowne, <hi>Hacket</hi> ſaying nothing thereunto.</p>
               <p>There was found alſo in <hi>Hackets</hi> Chamber, hidden at the beds
feete, many writings: and <hi>Walker</hi> (the owner of the houſe) brought
alſo vnto the ſaid <hi>Iones</hi> other writings of theirs, out of a ſtable.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Maſter Heiney</hi> parſon of the Church of <hi>Saint Mary-Somerſets</hi>
an honeſt and learned Preacher, looked on one of the
ſayd papers, <hi>Hacket</hi> reprouing him ſaid, that it appertayned not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, but vnto the Magiſtrates to looke on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arthington</hi> (in ſpeeches with the ſayd <hi>Heyney)</hi> ſayd amongs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, that the Iudgements of God ouer that Citie were very
great, and that the time was now come, that God would reforme
his Church vniuerſally, and roote out all Idolatrous prieſtes, and
that the Miniſters of that Citie were no better: affirming him ſelfe
to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſent purpoſely from God, to denounce his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that <hi>Coppinger</hi> was a greater Prophet then hee: that
<hi>Cartwright</hi> was a great learned man, and a Saint of God: but <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginton</hi>
was leſſe learned then he, yet farre before him in dignitie
for his zeale, alwayes concluding his ſpeeches with theſe wordes
of imprecation againſt himſelfe, viz. <hi>elſe God confound me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the ſayd Preacher demaunded of <hi>Hacket</hi> why he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>Arthington</hi> to bring him into ſuch blaſphemies, his anſwere
was, that abundance of zeale did cauſe him to exceede in that ſort.
Then he asked <hi>Hacket,</hi> how he liked that <hi>Arthington</hi> aſcribed vnto
him an Office peculiar to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> To which hee would not directly
anſwere, but ſayd, that God had a great worke to bring to paſſe by
himſelfe in this lande, affirming that himſelfe alſo was a <hi>Prophet,</hi>
and had endited that <hi>propheſie</hi> (which <hi>Arthington</hi> writ) to be ſent to
the <hi>Queene</hi> or <hi>Counſell,</hi> and that hee prayed to God to direct <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingtons</hi>
penne therein.</p>
               <p>This ſtrange accident being quickely blowen through the citie,
all was in a buzze, and in a kinde of aſtoniſhment, what to thinke
of the matter: and beeing ſpeedily brought to her <hi>Maieſties</hi> eares,
(then lying but at <hi>Greenewich)</hi> two of her honourable Counſell
were preſently diſpatched vnto <hi>London,</hi> to take further notice of the
whole matter. About one of the clocke in the afternoone, <hi>Coppinger</hi>
was ſent for, whiles <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> were brought before
thoſe honourable Counſellors and others at the <hi>L. Maiors</hi> to be
examined: but (as is informed) they would not ſhew any token of
duetie or reuerence vnto thoſe honourable perſons, not ſo much as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9293:37"/>
by putting off their hattes vnto them. Then their hattes were pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
off by others, and they were tolde their dueties, and were asked
whether they did not know before whome they ſtoode? To which
they anſwered, that they knew them right well: neuertheleſſe they
would yeelde them no duetie nor reuerence, inſomuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
(they ſayde) were greater perſons, then thoſe before whom
they were conuented, yet they ſeemed well content to ſtande bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
ſo their hattes were taken off by force, and not put off by
their owne willes. This courſe of inſolent behauiour towardes all
that examined them, both <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> helde on, at
ſundry other their examinations. Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Arthington</hi> that
was ſo ſcrupulous to yeelde any reuerence to the <hi>Queenes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,</hi>
and <hi>Officers,</hi> at one time when hee ſawe <hi>Hacket,</hi> preſently fell
downe groueling vpon his face on the ground and honoured him,
according to the Conuention among them mentioned before.
And albeit both theſe continued ſtill reſolute in their former fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
conceiued of their <hi>extraordinarie</hi> callings and Offices, and
ſought moſt abſurdly to defende it by Scripture, (but chiefely by
moſt terrible imprecations vnto them ſelues, praying to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
and damned if they ſayde not true:) yet to all queſtions
that were aſked of them, they anſwered (though moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently)
yet pertinently, and directly to purpoſe, ſaying, that <hi>Hacket</hi> vſed
the matter ſomewhat more craftily, when any queſtion of eſpeciall
danger was propounded vnto him. For then would he by cunning
euaſions, by cauils, and by fruſtratorie kindes of anſweres goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to put off ſuch interrogatories, ſeeming when hee was preſſed
ſomewhat hard, to bee wearie of his part and perſon put on, if hee
could haue then tolde how to haue ſhaken it off, and bene ridde of
it againe, with any honeſtie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coppinger</hi> (ſoone after his firſt examination) finding the euent
of things not to anſwere their expectations, ſeeing alſo the matter
ſomewhat warmely taken (as there was good cauſe) and thereby
gathering the danger which hee and his complices ſtoode in, and
perceiuing alſo (by the queſtions asked) the intercepting of their
writings and Letters, whereby their dealings were at full diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and brought to light; beganne, either by his owne voluntarie
choiſe (as ſome perhappes not vnprobably haue imagined) or
through anxietie (in deede) of minde, growing foorth of the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the cauſe, to behaue himſelfe as a man diſtracted of his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9293:38"/>
wits. Inſomuch as comming at one time to be examined, &amp; finding
<hi>Hacket</hi> there, at his ſight he preſently roared out, in a very ſtrange
and horrible kinde of voyce: which <hi>Hacket</hi> willing to turne to the
beſt, ſtraightway ſaid, It was no marueile, though <hi>Coppinger</hi> did
now ſo behaue himſelfe, for that he had giuen him ouer already vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Sathan.</p>
               <p>By peruſall of their writings and Letters, and by their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all the plots of treaſon and lewdneſſe (afore mentioned) fell
out very euidently, and more at full againſt them.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Queenes</hi> armes defaced at <hi>Kayes</hi> houſe, <hi>Hacket</hi>
did confeſſe, at the times of his examination, that hee did it, none
other beeing preſent, and that hee was mooued thereunto inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the ſpirit, to take away her whole power of her authoritie,
and that hee would haue done worſe, had it not bene for diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his hoſteſſe where he lay, becauſe when ſhee found it, ſhe was
very angrie therewith: for he was not ſorie, neither is ſorie (as hee
then ſaide) for doing the acte, becauſe hee was commaunded by
God to doe it, and durſt doe none otherwiſe. Hee confeſſed alſo,
that he was likewiſe moued to put out the Lyons and the Dragons
eyes in the armes: but being aſked, why he did ſo? he bitterly and
maliciouſly anſwered, that hee did knowe, that Lyons and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
did afflict Gods people. Hee did alſo raſe out the croſſe, that
was pictured on the toppe of the Crowne. Hee further confeſſed,
that he meant alſo her Maieſties Counſell ſhould bee remooued,
becauſe they were (hee ſayde) wicked: and that hee himſelfe (bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mooued by the ſpirit) would haue placed certaine other new
Counſellors (whome hee then named) to wayte vpon the <hi>Queene,</hi>
and to reforme Religion. It is alſo confeſſed by him, that he tolde
<hi>Arthington</hi> and others, that hee was the annoynted King of
<hi>Europe.</hi> By the depoſitions of the ſayde <hi>Kaye</hi> and his wife, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that they finding (about a fortenight before <hi>Hackets</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from them) the <hi>Queenes Maieſties</hi> picture pricked with
ſome bodkin or yron inſtrument in the very place, repreſenting
her royall heart, did in great anger charge <hi>Hacket</hi> with it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
hee anſwered, that hee had done it, and muſt and would
anſwere it; adding, hee had greater matters to anſwere then that,
and therefore (ſayde hee) you neede not make ſuch adoe for it.
But <hi>Hacket</hi> at all his examinations eyther denyed this poynt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or ſayde, hee did not remember it. This Noble heart, which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9293:38"/>
thereby hee ſo trayterouſly deſpited, God of his infinite mercy
long bleſſe and continue ſtill moſt happie and heartie in his loue
and feare, within her Maieſties ſacred breaſt, maugre all ſuch exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
fierie ſpirits and hell houndes in earth, and all the damned
deuils in hell. Amen.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe hee confeſſed, that hee mooued and ſent foorth <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi>
and <hi>Arthington,</hi> to goe whither God ſhould ſende them,
and to declare and publiſh, that there lay a man (namely hee
the ſayde <hi>Hacket)</hi> at <hi>Walkers</hi> houſe, which made clayme to
the Crowne of <hi>Englande,</hi> and that <hi>her Maieſtie</hi> had forfaited
her Crowne, in that her Miniſters haue vſed extraordinarie
meanes to ſet vp religion. This hee confeſſed on the one and
twentieth, and three and twentieth of <hi>Iuly.</hi> But at his former exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
on the nineteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> beeing demaunded whether
hee woulde acknowledge that the <hi>Queenes Maieſtie</hi> is lawfull
Queene of <hi>Englande</hi> or not? hee ſubtilly then ſayde, hee woulde
not anſwere to that queſtion, but ſayde, ſhee was <hi>Queene of
Englande yet,</hi> if ſhee had not forfaited the ſame. And hee further
confeſſed (on the three and twentieth day of <hi>Iuly)</hi> that hee firſt
publiſhed in <hi>Hamp-ſhire</hi> (about three or foure yeeres paſt) and
afterwardes in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Northhamptonſhire,</hi> that her
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> was not <hi>Queene,</hi> and that ſhee had forfaited her title to
the <hi>Crowne:</hi> and that hee tolde <hi>Arthington</hi> ſo much in <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi>
terme. All theſe aforeſayde, were confeſſed by him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any torture: but beeing tortured, hee then ſang another
ſong, and confeſſed her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> to bee his lawfull <hi>Queene,</hi> and
affirmed, that hee honoured her, and was ſorie for his offence:
adding, that if <hi>Coppinger, Wigginton,</hi> and one other (whome he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
were well ſifted, and ſtraightly examined, they would vtter
and declare ſundry matters of treaſon.</p>
               <p>It fell out beſides vpon depoſition of <hi>Kayes,</hi> that <hi>Coppinger</hi> (bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told how <hi>Hacket</hi> had vſed the <hi>Queenes</hi> picture and the Armes)
at the firſt ſeemed to miſlike with it, ſaying, that if he were ſuch a
fellowe, he had done with him; but (ſayth hee) you muſt beare
with him: for ſome great men haue alſo borne with him, and he is
with you, but as it were a priſoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coppinger</hi> himſelfe alſo at that his examination (which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the 19. of <hi>Iuly)</hi> confeſſed, that the Letter then ſhewed to him,
(and inſerted afore) was the copie of a Letter which he ſent to the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9293:39"/>
ſaid <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> about ten weekes then paſt, and that the cauſe why
hee wrote to <hi>Vdall</hi> that <hi>hee vſed not to repayre vnto him and the reſt
who were in priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo often as he was wont to doe, for doubt of more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and danger that might growne to them thereby,</hi> was, <hi>in reſpect of this
action, which he had to doe:</hi> hee alſo then affirmed, that the <hi>Queenes
Maieſtie, Queene Elizabeth,</hi> is not <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> neither is he
(as hee ſayde) now her ſeruant, for <hi>Hacket</hi> is the onely king of the
worlde, and that <hi>Hacket</hi> was commaunded by God to deface her
Maieſties Armes which were in the houſe where hee then lay, and
that <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo prickt the picture of the <hi>Queenes Maieſtie</hi> at the
heart. That himſelfe, <hi>Wigginton,</hi> and one other (the very weeke afore
<hi>Wigginton</hi> was committed) had a Faſt together, where they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if any of them ſhould haue any <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling, they
might haue ſome <hi>extraordinarie</hi> ſeale of it: about the which time,
he the ſayd <hi>Coppinger</hi> was called in a Dreame. And that hee (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Arthington,</hi> and one other) had a former Faſt at the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>Lancaſters</hi> houſe, about one weeke afore that time: and that
her Maieſties Counſell (that now are) muſt be tryed by this King,
whether they are to bee remooued from <hi>her Maieſtie</hi> or not: and
that ſhee is to haue to be about her to attend her perſon (for the
time) ſuch as himſelfe ſhould aſſigne, which ſhalbe thoſe, whome
he hath named in a Letter of his, that is found with him: and ſome
others alſo (hee ſayde) were meant to haue bene aſſigned alſo for
that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>There fell out alſo vpon ſome of <hi>Arthingtons</hi> examinations
(whiles he remained obſtinate) certaine other poyntes not vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be remembred. One was, that wheras he, in writing of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
againſt the ſtate of this Church as it now ſtandeth, obſerued
(as hee ſayeth) therein his olde woont to abſtayne from bitter
ſpeeches and raylings, as a thing which hee naturally abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
yet within theſe fewe Moneths, and after hee had entred
into theſe actions, hee had altered his opinion, and was mooued
in ſpirite, to followe another ſharpe and biting courſe of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as beeing more conuenient in his iudgement. Alſo, when
ſome that examined him, ſtoode greatly vpon this point, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him, that he was ſeduced in thoſe things wherein he ſeemed
ſo reſolute: and reaſoned againſt ſuch their pretended <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
callings, giftes, and offices: then hee (for better confirmation
thereof) ſaid: that it ſhould very ſhortly appeare to the world, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9293:39"/>
they were no ſuch ſeduced perſons, as was imagined. For whereas
a godly Gentlewoman in <hi>London</hi> (ſo he termed her) had bene by
the ſpace of foureteene yeeres, poſſeſſed with a diuell, (as is afore
touched) that (for a ſure ſigne of their vocation) the ſaide deuill
ſhould be throwen out of her, by all, or ſome of their three meanes,
very ſhortly. He alſo perſiſted willfull in his former fanſies, vntil the
very time that he knewe <hi>Hacket</hi> was hanged, for vntill that day, he
very confidently affirmed, that he was moſt aſſured by the ſpirite of
God, and by the ioyes and comfort he inwardly felt, that <hi>Hacket</hi>
did participate with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a part of his office, and was in deede
king of all <hi>Europe,</hi> on whome <hi>her Maieſtie</hi> and all other, muſt hold
their crownes and ſcepters, and muſt gouerne (if they would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
their gouernment) by ſuch lawes, as he ſhould preſcribe and
ſet forth, that all they three ſhould ſhortly be diſmiſſed, and ſhoulde
goe ouer ſea with <hi>Hacket,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of all thoſe his other
kingdomes abroad, and to performe their <hi>offices.</hi> But when the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and danger of this ſtrange fanſie was opened vnto him, his
anſwere was to this effect: You thinke (ſaith he ſomewhat plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly,
as it were pitying their errour and miſconceit) that we haue
incurred the danger of lawes herein: and that we ſhall therefore be
put to death: but as ſure as God is in heauen, the ſworde ſhall not
come neere to hurt vs, neither ſhall any man bee able to touch the
leaſt haire of any of our heads.</p>
               <p>Thus, the meane time (for the moſt part thereof) from <hi>Friday</hi>
the 16. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> vntill <hi>Munday</hi> ſeuennight after, being ſpent in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
it was thought good, that <hi>Hacket</hi> ſhould then come to
his triall: on which day (being the 26. of <hi>Iuly)</hi> hee was brought
from <hi>Bridewell</hi> to the Seſſions houſe neere <hi>Newgate,</hi> before the
<hi>Lord Maior,</hi> the <hi>Lord Wentworth, Sir Gilbert Gerrard</hi> knight, Maſter
of the Rolles, <hi>Sir Wolſtane Dixie,</hi> and <hi>Sir Richard Martin</hi> knight,
<hi>M. Sergeant Fleetwood</hi> Recorder of <hi>London, M. Daniel</hi> and others in
that Commiſſion: where after the graund Iurie was empannelled,
the witneſſes that ſhoulde giue euidence ſworne, and two ſeuerall
Indictments againſt him found, <hi>Hacket</hi> was willed to holde vp his
hand, which he did: then the firſt Indictment was read being of this
tenor being turned into Engliſh, viz.</p>

and defaced the Armes of the Queenes Maieſtie then and there

further accompliſhing and effecting of his ſaid traiterous purpoſes,

<hi>W. Hacket,</hi> trayterouſly came to the houſe of one <hi>Iohn Walker</hi> ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and being in the pariſh of <hi>S. Marie Sommerſets</hi> in the ward of

Gent. concerning his traiterous purpoſes, imaginations,
compaſſings, &amp; intents aforeſaid, And that the ſaid <hi>William Hacket</hi>
afterward, that is to ſay, on the 16. day of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the 33. yere of the
reigne of the Q. Maieſtie that nowe is, at <hi>London</hi> aforeſaide in the
houſe of the ſaide <hi>Iohn Walker,</hi> in the foreſaid pariſh of <hi>S. Marie

&amp; trayterouſly, ſayd, rehearſed, publiſhed and ſpoke, viz. That
the Q. Maieſtie, (meaning our ſaide Soueraigne Ladie Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth)</hi>
had forfaited her Crowne, and was worthie to bee depriued.
And that furthermore the ſaid <hi>William Hacket</hi> thereupon the ſayd
16. day of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the ſaid 33. yeere, in the ſaid houſe of <hi>Iohn Walker</hi>
ſituate in the pariſh of <hi>S. Marie Sommerſets</hi> in the ſayde ward of
<hi>Queene-hithe London,</hi> maliciouſly, and traiterouſly moued &amp; ſtirred
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9293:41"/>
vp the ſayd <hi>Edmund Coppinger,</hi> and <hi>Henrie Arthington,</hi> traiterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and openly to publiſh and declare in <hi>London</hi> aforeſayd, that the
Queenes Maieſtie that now is, had forfaited her crowne to the
great offence and derogation of the perſon of the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
and to the ſubuerſion of the ſtate of this Realme of <hi>England,</hi>
and contray to the peace of our ſaid ſoueraigne Lady, her crowne
and dignities, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And being likewiſe asked whether he were guiltie to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement
or not (belike perceiuing that he was already plunged in
farre inough) he began then to anſwere more peruerſlie, ſaying to
the Bench, <hi>You haue wit ynough to iudge for me &amp; your ſelues too:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked the ſame againe, hee ſayd, <hi>Fewe words are beſt, it is good to
know much and to ſay litle:</hi> and being diuers times asked, he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
theſe wordes. Then being told that if hee ſhould perſiſt in
that ſort, not to plead directly as by lawe hee ought, it could not
ſerue his turne, for that alone was ſufficient of it ſelfe, to condemne
him of the treaſon: and being asked againe whether hee were
guiltie or not, hee ſayd, <hi>Ambo.</hi> But ſome further good aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being giuen vnto him, at laſt (after much adoe) he pleaded
not guiltie to that ſecond Indictment. Thereupon being asked, by
whom he would be tried? he ſayd by the countrey: but being told
he ought to ſay, <hi>By God and by the countrey,</hi> he ſaid, that he would be
tried by the <hi>Iurie.</hi> And there withall, burſt out into ſuch blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and helliſh wordes againſt the <hi>Maiestie</hi> of God (in trueth
not to be heard by Chriſtian eares, and therefore not to be vitered
or repeated here) that they were to the great aſtoniſhment and
horrour of all, and deteſtation of him with all the hearers. It may
be that he hoped thereby to induce the Iudges to an opinion, that
he was mad and furious, albeit in his countinance, geſture, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiueneſſe
to that which was ſpoken, ſilence when hee ought, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vp his hand when he was commaunded, perceiuing the effect
of all was ſpoken, pertinent (though ſometimes peruerſe) anſwers,
through all that action, no tokens of any furie or madneſſe at all
could be noted in him.</p>
               <p>Some haue imagined that the Illuſion of the deuil was ſo ſtrong
to perſwade him of an immunitie from all danger, according to his
former conceiued opinions, that thereby he grew to ſuch a diueliſh
impatience againſt God, when as now hee ſawe himſelfe to bee
brought to more apparant danger, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (happely) he ſuppoſed there
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9293:42"/>
euer would be cauſe for him to feare. Which thing ſeemeth more
probable to haue bene the occaſion thereof, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> immediately after
his blaſphemie, he alſo vſed theſe words: <hi>God almightie is aboue,
and will he not reuenge?</hi> But ſeeing hee could not bee brought to
any other plea, the <hi>Queenes Attorney</hi> generall, deſired in behalfe
of the <hi>Queene,</hi> that iudgement thereupon might be entered. And
ſeeing hee pleaded guiltie to the one, and ſtood mute to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
in that hee anſwered not as law would (whereupon he was
to bee conuicted of both the Inditements) ſo that none Euidence
(which was there readie) needed either to bee vſed, or by the
<hi>Queenes</hi> Counſell learned to be opened or enforced: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
for better ſatiſfaction of the world, it was by them thought
meete, ſomewhat to ſhew, both how hainous, and how euident
(for proofe) his treaſons were. And albeit I am not able (in any
tolerable ſort) to repeate the graue, wiſe, and pithie diſcourſes
that were made in this behalfe, by thoſe two woorthie gentlemen
maſter <hi>Attorney generall,</hi> and maſter <hi>Sollicitor</hi> to her <hi>Maieſtie:</hi> yet
(I hope) they will pardon me, to ſet downe onely ſome few heads
of their ſpeaches, as they were noted brieflie from their mouthes,
and afterward brought vnto mee. Maſter <hi>Attorney</hi> declared, that
the originall of theſe plots and conſpiracies came from, and were
for the Sectaries of this time: that <hi>Coppinger</hi> in a letter to <hi>Vdall</hi>
prayeth him and the reſt in priſon not to ſaint: that he and others
had taken a courſe for their ſpeedie deliuerance, and deſired par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for not comming to him, which hee ſayd might bee dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
for that they ſhould bee the ſooner ſuſpected, or to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
that there were letters diſperſed in the ſtreetes fiue or ſixe
dayes before the action: that there were found in <hi>Wiggintons</hi>
chamber printed pamplets, which ſhould bee ſent to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of women (whom I, quoth maſter <hi>Attorney</hi> forbeare to
name) as is touched before: that in other letters was contained,
that the <hi>Queene</hi> ſhould commaund her Counſellors to their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
becauſe of the ſtirre and danger which then ſhould bee: that
<hi>Hacket</hi> himſelfe had afore confeſſed (beſides the other points of
the Inditements) how he ſent <hi>Arthington</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi> to do and
proclaime as they did.</p>
               <p>Then maſter <hi>Sollicitor</hi> very excellently alſo diſcourſed, how there
was no treaſon more dangerous then that, which is practiſed vnder
other colours, as it were in the cloudes, and none wounded ſo deep
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9293:42"/>
as thoſe that were ſhadowed vnder the cloke of religion &amp; zeale:
for of it commonly followed greateſt deſtruction and calamities.
This he exemplified by the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> at <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Westphalia,</hi>
and ſome others: that in like ſort (as they did) this <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo
affirmeth hee was ſent from God, was a principall <hi>Angel</hi> ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Iudgement, that he doth participate (with horror I reherſe
it, ſaid maſter <hi>Sollicitor)</hi> of the humane nature of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and
the two other are <hi>Prophets,</hi> one of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the other of <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
That the <hi>Queene</hi> had forfeited her crowne: that the counſell
was wicked, and muſt be ouer-ruled, and by whom but by him? &amp;c
Then he ſhewed what <hi>Hacket</hi> was, viz. a Bankrupt: that hee had
maried a widow, and had ſpent all.</p>
               <p>Which done, maſter <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> gaue iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Hacket</hi> as in like caſes is accuſtomed. From thence <hi>Hacket</hi> was
caried to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and there remained till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next after
(being the appointed day for his execution) that in the meane
while he might (by godly counſell) be brought to repentance, and
to prouide for his ſoules health. Certaine preachers ſo trauelled
with him in the meane time, that albeit (for ſome while) he thought
to aduantage himſelfe, and to reſpite his execution, by giuing
(through diſſimulation) froward and lewd anſwers, yet at length
they brought him (as it then ſeemed) to a ſerious conſideration of
his owne ſtate, and of the grieuouſneſſe of his treaſons. In ſo much
as maſter <hi>Richard Yong</hi> of <hi>London</hi> comming alſo vnto him thither,
on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> being the 27. of Iuly, betwixt the houres of ſix and
ſeuen in the after noone (ſundry others alſo being in company) he
found him (in outward apparance) well affected. For when maſter
<hi>Yong</hi> wiſhed him to ſubmit himſelfe, and to confeſſe his fault to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
almightie God, hee preſently with good wordes did it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
Then maſter <hi>Yong</hi> told him that God had appoynted
death vnto all men, but vnto diuers in diuers ſorts, and wiſhed him
to take patiently that which God had laied vpon him. This <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
ſayd hee would vnfainedly doe, and withall asked the <hi>Queenes
Maiestie</hi> for giueneſſe, ſaying, hee was very ſory for the wordes
hee had ſpoken, and that it was a gracious and happy turne, that
their treaſons were in time reuealed: for otherwiſe it would
haue coſt a number of innocent men their blouds, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
(hee thought) ſhould neuertheleſſe alſo, haue bene ſlayne
amongſt them: but now he truſted in God, that the others would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9293:43"/>
confeſſe alſo their treaſons, and that her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> was a gracious
Prince, and would forgiue them if they asked mercie. And if it
would alſo pleaſe her highnes, to be ſo gracious vnto him as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him, he would hencefoorth become a good ſubiect. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
(becauſe he had no money) he then deſired <hi>M. Yong</hi> either to
giue or to lend him ſome money: ſaying, he would repay it againe,
if euer he were able, who thereupon did his deuotion towards him.
Then <hi>Hacket</hi> thanked him, and deſired maſter <hi>Yong</hi> to pray for
him. Thus hee continued in good temper that night, and the next
morning, vntill (looking out at one of the windowes into the
ſtreete leading towards <hi>Chepeſide)</hi> he ſawe all the ſtreete euen fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
(as it were) vp with people, expecting his execution. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he began to anſwere ſuch as exhorted him very deſperately,
and blaſphemouſly: and when as comming downe the ſtaires, one
of the Shiriffs wiſhed him to be mindfull of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> death, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
for him, hee thereupon vttered moſt execrable blaſphemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Chriſtes</hi> bleſſed paſſion.</p>
               <p>Hee was brought from <hi>Newgate</hi> towards the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the eight and twentieth day of <hi>Iulie</hi> (being <hi>Wedneſday)</hi> after
tenne of the clocke in the morning, albeit by reaſon of the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
multitude (then in the ſtreetes) but eſpecially in <hi>Chepeſide</hi>
from one end thereof vnto another (the like whereof at no aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
in memorie hath bene ſeene) it was very long ere the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
(with all they could doe) could get him to the very place.
All the way that hee was dragged vpon the hurdle, hee continued
his counterfeit vayne that he had then vndertaken: one while cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <hi>Iehouah Meſſias, Iehouah Meſſias:</hi> another while crying
out thus: Looke, looke, how the heauens open wide, and the
ſonne of God commeth downe to deliuer me. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came vnder
the gibbet (which was reared hard by the croſſe in <hi>Chepeſide,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the right hand of the ſtreete as you come from <hi>Paules)</hi> and
the noiſe beyng appeaſed, hee was exhorted to aske God, and the
<hi>Queene</hi> forgiueneſſe, and to fall to his prayers: but he perſeuering
in his vnprofitable courſe of diſſimulation, in ſtead thereof, fell to
rayling and curſing of the <hi>Queenes Maieſtie,</hi> moſt villanouſlie.
But beyng more vehemently vrged to remember his preſent
ſtate, and to giue ouer all hope to doe himſelfe good by ſuch
diſſembling, hee beganne to pray this moſt paſſionate, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
and execrable prayer, videlicet. <hi>O God of heauen, mightie
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9293:43"/>
Iehouah,</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>Lord of Lordes, King of Kings, and God
euerlasting, that knoweſt me to be that true Iehouah, whome thou hast
ſent: ſend ſome miracle out of a cloude to conuert theſe Infidels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
me from theſe mine enemies: If not, I will fire the heauens, and
teare thee from thy throne with my handes.</hi> With other words of moſt
execrable blaſphemie againſt the diuine Maieſtie of God (not to
be rehearſed) by reaſon that he found not that deliuerance, which
he fanſied God to haue promiſed. Then turning towards the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,</hi>
he ſaid vnto him, Ah thou baſtards childe, wilt thou hange
<hi>William Hacket</hi> thy king? The <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and people deteſting
this ſubtill, ſeditious, and blaſphemous humour, commanded and
cried to the Officers to diſpatch with him, or to haue his mouth
ſtopped from blaſpheming: but they had much a doe to get him
vp the ladder: And when he was vp, he ſtruggled with his head to
and fro, (aſwel as he could) that he might not haue the fatal nooſe
put ouer his head. Then he asked them (very fearefully) <hi>O what do
you, what doe you?</hi> but ſeeing by the circumſtance, what they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he beganne to raue againe, and ſaide, Haue I this for my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
beſtowed vpon thee? I come to reuenge thee, and plague
thee, and ſo was turned off. But the people vnwilling that ſo trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous
and blaſphemous a wretch, ſhould haue any the leaſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
cryed out mightily to haue him cut downe preſently, to be
quartered, and ſeemed very angrie with the Officers, that made no
more haſte therein: but as ſoone almoſt as he was cut downe, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with a trice) his heart was taken foorth, and ſhewed out open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the people, for a moſt deteſtable, blaſphemous traytors heart.</p>
               <p>Thus died the moſt dangerous firebrand of ſedition, moſt dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
traitor, moſt hypocriticall ſeducer, and moſt execrable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
helhound, that many ages euer ſawe, or heard of, in this
lande.</p>
               <p>The next day after this (being <hi>Thurſday,) Coppinger</hi> hauing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
abſtained from meate (as is ſaid) ſeuen or eight daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
died in <hi>Bridewell:</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> liueth yet in the Counter in
<hi>Woodſtreete,</hi> reſerued (I hope) vnto ſincere and perfite repentance.
For immediatly vpon <hi>Hackets</hi> execution, hee wrote a letter vnto
two great <hi>Counſellors,</hi> (whome among others he had lewdly ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered)
of ſubmiſſion, and afterwards (more at large) he wrote to
the bodie of the Councell, the whole courſe (as he pretendeth) of
this action, ſo farre as he was made acquainted therewith, humbly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9293:44"/>
crauing their Lordſhips mediation vnto the <hi>Queenes moſt excellent
Maiestie</hi> for his pardon, and acknowledging his dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and diueliſh ſeduction (by <hi>Hacket</hi> eſpecially) into this traito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
action.</p>
               <p>This declaration is truely taken foorth of their owne letters, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
vnder their hands, and their confeſſions vpon examinations,
ſubſcribed by themſelues, and by ſundry honourable and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
perſons of great grauitie, and wiſedome, before whome they
were made: and therefore may ſuffice, to ſhewe vnto all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and well affected, the lewdnes and danger of the hypocriticall
plots, and ſedicious conſpiracies entred into by theſe perſons.</p>
               <p>But ſome there are ſo peruerſely wedded to their owne wils,
and addicted to their fanſies once conceaued, that they giue out
they were madde, and furious perſons, chooſing therein, rather to
accuſe the honourable <hi>Iustice</hi> of the <hi>Realme,</hi> and all the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
thereof, then that any of their factious crewe (profeſſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of pretended Reformation, and to bring in <hi>The Diſcipline</hi> (as
they call it) ſhould be noted with ſo deepe diſloialtie.</p>
               <p>As it is not the part of any honeſt <hi>Christian,</hi> by calumniation to
charge thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be innocent: ſo doth it not become a loyall ſubiect,
to iuſtifie any traytors, eſpecially w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſlandering of the State. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeemeth requiſite, that this point be not left vncleared: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they or any of them, in theſe practiſes, were in deed tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported
with furie, beſides themſelues, ſo as they needed not to haue bene
regarded, nor (by lawe) ought to haue ſuffered death for them?</p>
               <p>In wants of vnderſtanding and reaſon (after ſuch time as men
ſhould naturally haue them) there are noted diuers degrees, that
are alſo of ſeuerall conſideration, that is to ſay: <hi>Furor ſiue Rabies:
Dementia ſiue Amentia: Inſania ſiue Phreneſis: Fatuitas, Stultitia,
Lethargia, &amp; Deliriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And albeit the three firſt (by ſundry writers)
be ſometimes confounded &amp; taken for one, like as alſo the fourth

               <p>Nowe then, to examine theſe three perſons by that which hath
bene ſaide: It may be yeelded, that their imaginations, purpoſes,
plots, and deſignements, reſpecting the weightines of the end, and
weakenes of the meanes, were fantaſticall, vnaduiſed, &amp; moſt fond
and vnlikely, yet none otherwiſe then may be alſo truely ſaide for

cannot (truly or with any colour of probabilitie) be affirmed, that
any of them were mad, beſide themſelues, and out of their wits, as
not knowing and perceiuing what they did or ſaid, or what others
ſaid or did vnto them.</p>
               <p>Firſt concerning <hi>Arthington,</hi> I haue not heard ſo much as any
doubt at all of madnes to haue bene made by any man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed,
or had to deale with him, either in, or after this action. But
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9293:45"/>
becauſe <hi>Coppinger</hi> hath bene ſuppoſed by many (after the time of
his firſt examination) to haue fallen into ſtarke madnes, let vs a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
looke backe, &amp; briefly recapitulate ſome points, that haue bene
afore touched concerning him, to ſee, if any ſuch diſtraction of
mind could alſo be noted in him, by the carriage of this action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his apprehenſion. Yet I doe know, that it hath bene doubted
(vpon ſome good ground) by wiſe men, whether he were in deed
mad, euen at any time after he was apprehended, as he made ſhew,
or whether it were onely fained by him. For a mad man may, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times doth, for 2. or 3. daies together, eate no meate, nor happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drinkes not at al. But when the humors of his ſtomacke are fully
concocted &amp; put ouer, ſo that for want of food, it beginneth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to ſucke backe the blood &amp; nouriſhment, diſtributed afore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the veines &amp; parts, which breedeth hunger: then wil a mad man
(moſt commonly) very greedily &amp; rauenouſly, euen by courſe of
nature, fall to his meate, if it be ſhewed him, &amp; cannot abſtaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot diſſemble this appetite, in the time of his furie. But
<hi>Coppinger</hi> is ſaid to haue forborne &amp; abſtained from meate &amp; drink
(though they were offred vnto him) by the ſpace of 8. whole daies:
whereby he grew ſo weake, as that it may ſeeme, he died for want
of ſuſtenance. Such reſolution or obduration of mind, can hardly ſo
long together remaine with him, that is madde in deed, &amp; knoweth
not what he doeth. Howſoeuer it were after, it is ſure, that before
their pageant was plaied, (wherein matters proſpered not as they
expected) the whole courſe of his ſpeeches, writings, &amp; other dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
were ſuch, as doe argue no defect at all of reaſon, memorie,
wit, or vnderſtanding, ſetting aſide the abſurditie and follie of the
fanſie, wherewith he was led.</p>
               <p>For when he firſt had taken apprehenſion of ſuch <hi>extraordinarie</hi>
calling, he yeelded not ſtreight way &amp; vnaduiſedly vnto it, but after
long &amp; deliberate debating with himſelfe: his care was great, and
courſe (as in ſuch a matter) was conſiderate, in ſeeking to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by ſuch, as he both then, &amp; afore held, to be beſt able to iudge
of his gifts &amp; calling: the queſtions that he framed were very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to that purpoſe, and orderly penned: his letters &amp; ſpeeches
to <hi>T. C.</hi> to <hi>Eg.</hi> to <hi>Ch.</hi> to <hi>Vd.</hi> to <hi>Lan.</hi> to <hi>Wig.</hi> to <hi>P. W.</hi> to <hi>I. T.</hi> and others,
and to them of forreine Churches, were (for that matter) well and
aduiſedly indited: his cunning was not ſmall, to keepe the very
particular way of effecting that which he deſired, from thoſe he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9293:46"/>
dealt with, becauſe himſelfe knewe it a dangerous ſecrete, and a
courſe not iuſtifiable, vnleſſe it came by <hi>extraordinarie</hi> motion, and
ſpeciall oeconomie from God, and therefore he deſired to haue it
allowed ſo to be: his pretenſe of entertaining intelligence (tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
ſome important ſeruice to the State of the Realme, whereof
he pretended to haue an inckling, but no full and particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
was none vnaduiſed or ſimple reache of policie, in him. For
if in platting of his purpoſes, and dealing in the principall action, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of doubtfull acceptance, ſhould happen to haue bene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſcouered, then might he well and with good colour, haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that hee did it but in way of attaining to intelligence of
thoſe dangers, whereof the generalitie (as it were in the cloudes)
he had afore deliuered to a <hi>Counſellor.</hi> For he might not ſeeme a
man to be ſuſpected of any diſloyall purpoſe, who ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſo careful for his Soueraignes ſafetie. Adde to theſe, his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to haue priſoners for treaſon, &amp;c. to be examined by
himſelfe, and execution of condemned perſons to be ſtaied at his
becke, whereby he might more eaſily haue induced them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach,
whom he liſt to haue ouerthrowen, and whom he principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aimed at. His ſubtiltie alſo doth notably appeare in his petitions
to her <hi>Maieſtie:</hi> where he makes ſhewe of great ſecretes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
onely in her preſence, and praieth to be pardoned, if in ouer
much feare of her ſafetie, he had attempted to prooue that, which
he could not, which argueth, that he had (in deede) not ſo much as
any colourable intelligence deliuered vnto him, of treaſon inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by ſuch great men, as he pretended: but vſed this as a meanes,
to haue acceſſe, for himſelfe and the others, vnto her Highnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
for ſome further intended miſchiefe: then his allowance and
commendation of ſound &amp; good counſel giuen him, by Eg. a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
and by others: his ſparing to reueale the great &amp; dangerous
ſecret vnto <hi>Hacket,</hi> vpon their firſt acquaintance: his raſing out of
<hi>Hackets</hi> and the Townes name, out of the letter ſent by him to a
Noble perſonage, to giue inckling of treaſons intended againſt
her <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> leaſt the qualitie and vnlikelihood of the man being
enquired after, that plat ſhould be daſhed: his not ſubſcribing of
his name to ſundry letters: his directing of <hi>Hacket,</hi> neither to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
nor endorſe (but in that ſorte as he preſcribed) for feare of
diſcouerie: his deſire to haue all the letters againe, that hee had
written to <hi>Eg.</hi> about that matter: his warie and diligent keeping of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9293:46"/>
copies, of euery letter that he writ in that cauſe: and when leaſure
ſerued not ſo to doe, his great care to haue the very letters againe:
his offence with one <hi>Hoc.</hi> for keeping a letter from him, which he
had ſent vnto him: his cunning excuſe of <hi>Hackets</hi> defacing of the
<hi>Queenes</hi> Armes: his counterfeite reuelation to bring <hi>Arthington</hi>
further in: his deuiſe to make <hi>Arthington</hi> reſolute, by ſaying it was
reuealed to him, that they had <hi>Angelicall</hi> ſpirits, not ſubiect to hurt,
by any mortall power: his willing choiſe to withdrawe himſelfe
into an houſe, when (after their proclamation) things fell not out
as was expected, and from thence afterward to goe to his place of
abode, thorough by-lanes: his and <hi>Hackets</hi> putting of the matter
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge of <hi>Arthington</hi> for a time, though afterward (happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
to be opened, why the <hi>Queene</hi> might not be praied for, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
their pretenſe of the Lordes commandement, to keepe the
meanes ſecret: how the <hi>Queenes Maieſtie</hi> and the <hi>Councel</hi> were to
be brought to repentance, and vnto their pretended Reformation:
The ſenſible and coherent manner of report vnto <hi>Wigginton,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Hackets</hi> and their own callings, and offices, by <hi>Coppinger</hi> and
<hi>Arthington:</hi> their temperate and pertinent anſweres vnto <hi>Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
ſpeeches, and all their conſulting ſundry times together, about
their buſines, namely, the night afore, and the day of their procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
doe plainely argue, that <hi>Coppinger</hi> (albeit he were greatly
miſled by a falſe and ſpitefull zeale, and by much hypocriſie) yet
was he farre ynough, from any diſtracting of his wits, in euery part
of this action.</p>
               <p>And concerning <hi>Hacket</hi> (whoſe terrible blaſphemies at the laſt,
doe argue either a villanous diſſimulation to haue his execution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpited,
or a deſperate intemperancie againſt God, for fruſtrating
his expectation) there can no furie or madnes bee iuſtly noted in
him, by the whole managing of this action, but rather, notable hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
craft, and diſſembled holines. Firſt, in that he ſeemed a
man moſt zealous for the pretended <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church, by
erecting <hi>the Diſcipline,</hi> and afterward alſo for reforming of the
Common-wealth: That hee vſed (in outward apparance) a moſt
feruent, and deuoute manner of praying: that in his prayers, he
did execrate himſelfe moſt deepely, if hee ſought not the glorie
of God onely in this action, thereby the better to be credited, and
to couer his villanies: that hee tooke a daies deliberation, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
the great matter, after it was firſt propounded by <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:9293:47"/>
that he ſought to get credit to himſelfe, &amp; to terrifie her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtie,</hi>
by telling (in generalities) of ſtrange iudgements of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
ouer her, that were reuealed vnto him: that foreſeeing it
not vnlikely to raine (after a long time of drought) hee praied in
<hi>Coppingers</hi> preſence for raine, wherby it might ſeeme to be ſent by
God, at his onely praier &amp; mediation: that he bare them in hand
he could tell thinges to come, being meerely contingent: that he
could faine ſuch kind of <hi>Reuelations,</hi> as if they were ſhewed to him
in the middeſt of his torments, which (if they be marked) tended
onely to haue himſelfe magnified, as a man placed moſt highly in
Gods fauour: that when the one of his followers ſeemed offended,
he craftily excuſed the miſlike which he had ſhewed, to heare her
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> praied for: that the better to colour his hatred &amp; malice,
he afterward praied for her himſelfe: that he cunningly induced
<hi>Coppinger,</hi> either to feigne or to fancie a Reuelation, that he, &amp; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>
muſt obey him the ſaide <hi>Hacket</hi> in all things: that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to diſpenſe with <hi>Arthington,</hi> for honouring him as king of
<hi>Europe,</hi> vntill he ſhould doe it before others, where it might ſtande
him in better ſteede: that he craftily put off his intended anointing
by <hi>Coppinger,</hi> (as being already done in heauen) leſt ſome (vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for) accident happely falling foorth, the whole pageant might
haue bene marred: that his prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded greateſt office of ſeuering (in
Chriſts behalfe) the good from the bad, with his fanne in his hand,
was concealed from <hi>Arthington,</hi> vntil the very time that the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
was to be done by them, when as it was too late to conſider of
it, &amp; vnlawful to be diſobeied: that this office he proclaimed vnto
them (after his two ſolemne praiers, for direction of them by Gods
ſpirit, to the glory of God onely) as it were an oracle newly drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
downe from heauen: that he anſwered <hi>Wiggintons</hi> queſtions
very cunningly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as touching the old Magiſtrats that were gone, and
the new come in place, meaning thereby (in trueth) the diſplacing
of al her <hi>Maieſties Councel:</hi> that he warily qualified <hi>Coppingers</hi> and
<hi>Arthingtons</hi> ſpeeches, which ſeemed vnto <hi>Wigginton,</hi> to attribute a
litle too much vnto him: that (comming through y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtreets, &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their proclamation had not made ſuch ſturre, as was hoped) he
then pretended vnto <hi>Wigg.</hi> that he had not ſet them on worke, but
maruailed what they meant therby, &amp; therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſignified, he would
depart y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> city, &amp; be gone home: that fearing what might happen in
the euent of the tumult, he ſent them into the ſtreets, but taried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9293:47"/>
in the houſe himſelf: that he put the trial of his ſaid pretended
great office (which he claimed in <hi>Chriſts</hi> roome) vpon this iſſue &amp;
trial, that none of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people which ſhould come to ſee him, had the
power to kill him: for hee knew that no priuate ſubiect might or
would attempt to do it, howſoeuer otherwiſe they tooke the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
that after the matter fel not out to his purpoſe, &amp; being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Walkers</hi> houſe, he rebuked <hi>Arth.</hi> ouermuch forwardnes, for
calling him there (openly before others) the <hi>king of the earth,</hi> &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
this in him, by his great zeale: that he ſlily auoided the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
which the miniſter of that pariſh did aske him touching
thoſe things which <hi>Arthington</hi> attributed vnto him: that hee vſed
at his examinations, many craftie euaſions, when any queſtion of
capitall danger to him was asked: that he conſtantly at all his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
perſiſted in denying, and ſaid he did not remember that
action which ſeemed moſt odiouſlie traiterous touching the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that part of the picture, which repreſented her <hi>Maieſties</hi> roiall
heart: that he denied alſo to haue ſent them to publiſh as they did:
that he did anſwer ſo doggedly and (in trueth) knauiſhly, to the
queſtion of defacing the Lion and Dragon in her <hi>Maieſties</hi> armes:
that to a queſtion (of moſt importance) whether her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> were
lawfull <hi>Queene of England?</hi> he refuſed to anſwer: that he ſubtilly
anſwered (albeit not to the lawfulneſſe of her being <hi>Queene)</hi> yet
ſhe was (in fact) <hi>Queeene</hi> as yet <hi>if ſhe had not forfeited it:</hi> that when
he was tortured, he reuoked his treaſons, and ſorowfully ſubmitted
himſelfe, a courſe which by the extremitie of paine (at the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying
of it) doth driue a man (being in deed mad) into a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rage and impatience then he was afore: that till he was tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
hee would not appeach any other his complices in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
that being not willing to plead directly to his ſecond indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he draue of the time with cunning anſweres, in deed impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nothing leſſe then madneſſe: that being in good temper, and
(as ſeemed) well diſpoſed in mind both the night before, and the
Wedneſday morning, vntill he ſawe no remedie, but that hee was
preſently to be executed, he burſt not foorth into his horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies:
and that at the very execution, in his greateſt impatience
pretended, (albeit his ſpeeches were moſt villanous agaynſt the
Queene, and blaſphemous towards God) yet he vnderſtood what
was ſayd and done, his wordes had ſenſe, and his prayer was cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
togither, one part with another. None of all which things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9293:48"/>
can happen or be found in him, that is in deed furious and

mind, which I ſayd in the beginning of this treatiſe, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
and reſemblance now enſuing bee conſidered, with theſe
mens purpoſes, opinions, and actions, which there I promiſed to
make betwixt them and certaine hereſies and tumults ſtirred vp in
<hi>Germanie,</hi> at the very beginning of the renewing of the light of
the Goſpell, by the preaching of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and others, the
briefe of which ſtorie is thus, viz.</p>
               <p>About ſixe or ſeuen yeeres after <hi>Luther</hi> began to preach the
Goſpell,<note place="margin">Sleidan lib. 4. &amp; 6.</note> the deuil (to diſturbe this worke) ſtirred vp certaine hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brained,
vnconſiderate, and importune preachers, that miſliked not
onely the doctrine of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but the doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> alſo, as
not being ſo ſpirituall, nor ſeruing ſo fitly for planting of puritie,
as they thought requiſite. By whoſe continual clamour, and ſharpe
Inuectiues agaynſt the enormities of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> ſtate, the
<hi>Nobilitie</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> ſuch effect was wrought, as that (in
ſhort time) there was kindled a moſt fearefull warre of aboue one
hundred thouſand of the common and vplandiſh people, riſing
and taking vp armes, almoſt about one time, in ſeuerall partes of
<hi>Germanie,</hi> where they ſacked townes, killed certaine of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,</hi>
and did many other outrages. For ſuch preachers hauing
ſet them on fire, did ſo harden them alſo, as that they could not be
wholy vanquiſhed, vntill (what in one place and in other of that
countrey) fiftie thouſand of them were killed, and cut in pieces by
the vnited forces of the moſt of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire.</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of theſe peaſants linking themſelues together, was in ſecret
conuenticles by night, and aſſemblies in priuate houſes, where
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9293:48"/>
they gaue mutuall fayth and oath, each of them to ſticke to other.
Their purpoſes and counſels were how to ouerthrow the ſtate <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall,</hi>
the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Counſels</hi> of Eſtate, in euery ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Prouince. When they were vp in armes, they made the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes
of their actions, to bee the defending, erecting, and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the preaching of the Goſpell through euery place. Being
once aſſembled in great troupes, they then ſet foorth and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
certaine points, which they required the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
to performe and yeeld vnto them, whereof theſe following
were ſome, amongſt ſundry other grieuances, which they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
were offered vnto them by <hi>Princes, Noble-men, Magiſtrates</hi>
and gentlemen, and whereof they vrged a Reformation, videlicet.
One petition of thoſe vplandiſh rebels was this: that they and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the common people, themſelues might euery where haue the
free choiſe of ſincere miniſters: another that Mortuaries might
wholy be taken away: a third, that they might bee disburdened of
paying any tithes to Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but onely corne: and a
fourth, that they might alſo preſcribe how theſe tithes ſhould bee
better emploied. <hi>Luther</hi> in an anſwere that the made to that booke
of theirs, ſaieth, hee conceiued that this ſedition was a very ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme
of <hi>Sathan:</hi> to the intent that the deuill might deſtroy and
kill him, and other true and ſound preachers of the Goſpell, by men
making outward ſhew and profeſſion of the ſame religion, becauſe
he ſawe he could not effect it, nor ſo farre preuaile by open aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
ſuch as the <hi>Pope</hi> was and his adherents. For theſe rebels
called themſelues a <hi>Chriſtian congregation,</hi> and bragged much, that
they would (in all their actions) follow the preciſe rule of Gods
word. And whereas (vnder the pretence of deteſtation of ſinne,
and of their owne great ſinceritie and good liues) theſe traiterous
rebels noted many faults in all other ſortes and ſtates of men, and
proteſted alſo great loyaltie and fidelitie to the perſons of their
<hi>Princes,</hi> ſo they might but haue things amiſſe reformed: he freelie
and truely putteth them in mind, that whiles they pried thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into other mens faultes, the deuill had ſo blinded them
(through pride and hypocriſie) that they could not ſee their
owne dereſtable treaſons, with other their ſinnes, and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
adding alſo, that ſuch as wreſt away or abate Princes
ſwordes and Iuriſdictions, will (vpon any fitte opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9293:49"/>
offered) no doubt, take away their liues alſo: which is chieflie
maintained by their ſoueraigne iuriſdiction, and by power of the
ſword.</p>
               <p>Amongſt others, <hi>Carolaſtadius</hi> a preacher, profeſſing the Goſpel,
but fallen into diſcontentments and emulous oppoſitions againſt
<hi>Luther:</hi> gaue no ſmall aduancement to this fearefull commotion.
This man attributed much to Cabinet teachers in priuate conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and vnto viſions, and pretended conferences with God. But
of all other preachers that pretended enmitie both to the <hi>Pope</hi> and
vnto <hi>Luther,</hi> one <hi>Thomas Muncer</hi> was the hotteſt and chiefeſt
<hi>bontifeu</hi> and bellowes of this ſedition. At firſt he vrged and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
men (in his teaching by a good ſpace together) and that with
great vehemencie, vnto a ſingular, ſtraite, preciſe, and holy courſe
of life: namely to flie all, euen the leaſt ſhew of actuall ſinne, to
faſt much, to array themſelues with meane and baſe rayment, to
retaine a ſetled auſteritie in countenaunce, to ſpeake ſeldome, and
ſuch like: which he called the bearing of the croſſe, mortification
and <hi>diſcipline.</hi> Now when as hereby hee had procured vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
a great opinion of holines and reputation with the common
people, he proceeded further vnto ſtrange and very dangerous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions:
for then he began to teach men in their prayers, to aske a
ſigne of God, whether they held the trueth in religion or not? that
if he gaue not a ſigne, they might importune him, and expoſtulate
with him, that hee delt not well with them in not giuing a ſigne to
them, who (in this ſort) begged but true knowledge of him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that to ſhew ſuch anger in prayer, was acceptable vnto God,
for that hereby men did ſhew their feruencie in zeale. Hee taught
alſo, that God (euen in theſe dayes) did reueale his will by dreams
and viſions: that all iudgements ciuill, muſt be by the <hi>Bible</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
from God: that all in dignitie muſt be equall. He rayled
againſt <hi>Princes,</hi> and imputed many faults vnto them, and namely
this, that they ſuffered the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> ſtate with great impietie.
This opinion of equalitie of authoritie and dignitie, made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people fall from their worke, and beginning to gad idlely vp
and downe, they tooke away (by violence) ſuch things as they had
need of, from thoſe that were more wealthie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muncer</hi> (in this ſort) winning many vnto him, they entered
from time to time into ſecrete leagues together, vpon mutuall
othes giuen, to helpe to roote out and kill all wicked magiſtrates,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9293:49"/>
to the intent newe that were more godly might be ſet in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for ſo (he ſaide) God had giuen in commandement vnto him.
According to which plots (by a tumult of the people) at <hi>Mulhuſin,</hi>
he procured the olde <hi>Officer</hi> to be depoſed, and a new <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to
be ſet vp in his place, and himſelfe to bee choſen a <hi>Senator</hi> of that
Citie, albeit he was ſtil a Preacher, and ſeemed to miſlike this courſe
in other men. Nowe when as by theſe and other like meanes, great
multitudes of men, to the number of fourtie thouſand had taken vp
armes, throughout <hi>Franconia,</hi> and <hi>Sucuia,</hi> then he thought oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
ſerued him to ſet forward his purpoſes, by adioyning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnto them: and in this action one <hi>Phyfer,</hi> a neere companion
of his, and like affected to him, did alſo ioyne. But when the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Rout wanted victuals, and many other neceſſaries, whereby
their courages began to faile: then hee comforted them in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and aſſured them (as from God) that their cauſe and quarrell
was ſo good, that the frame of the whole worlde ſhould ſooner be
changed, then they ſhould be forſaken, or left deſtitute of him. And
when the <hi>Princes</hi> armie (gathered to ſubdue them, being greater
and better furniſhed then theirs were) was ready to ioyne in battell,
hee ſtill moſt reſolutely aſſured them, of ſome euident miraculous
helpe, to bee manifeſted from Heauen, for the ouerthrowe of their
enemies: ſaying, that God woulde ſo enfeeble all their enemies
ſhot, that <hi>Muncer</hi> himſelfe would receiue them al (without harme)
into the lap of his coate, before they ſhould light: for a token here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it happened that they had taken the ſigne of a Raine-bowe for
their enſigne, he ſhewed them (as it fell out the ſelfe ſame time) a
true Rainebowe in Heauen, as an vndoubted ſigne, that they ſhould
obtaine the victorie. Whereupon they courageouſly at firſt ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ſinging a ſong for ayde by the holy Ghoſt: but being neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
all put in Rout and diſcomfited, <hi>Muncer</hi> fledde away, and
diſguiſed himſelfe. Yet by meanes of certaine letters that were
found with him, he was afterward in a houſe diſcouered, and taken.
Being brought before the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> he ſtoutly defended his fact,
affirming, that <hi>Princes,</hi> who refuſed to eſtabliſh the puritie of the
Goſpel, were in that ſort to be bridled. When he was brought to the
place of execution, &amp; ſaw no hope of eſcape (which before he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for) he grewe to be very. much deiected, &amp; perplexed in minde,
in ſo much, as without helpe of a godly <hi>Prince,</hi> which then ſtoode
by, he could not repeate ſo much as the articles of his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:9293:50"/>
I ſhall not neede to dwell long in the application and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of theſe poynts, vnto this late tragedie: the very reading of
them ouer, giuing ſufficient light vnto the ſame. For the ſharpe and
angrie zeale of ſome vnaduiſed Preachers, which pretend neither
to like of the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor of the preſent ſtate of the Church, for want
of ſome puritie, as they fanſie, hath it not incenſed, and made to
boyle ouer, not onely the foule mouthes of <hi>Martiniſts,</hi> but alſo the
traiterous actions of theſe Conſpirators? And albeit the common
multitude (whom the <hi>Diſciplinarians</hi> bragge to bee already infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with zeale, ready to lend a hundred thouſande handes for the
aduancement of their cauſe, and by whom they hope and ſay ſuch
Reformation muſt at laſt bee brought in) did better keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
out of this action then was expected: Yet the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was as great, and if it had once taken head, would (happely) as
hardly as the other haue bene ſubdued. Were not the treaties of
theſe men alſo in priuate houſes at night-faſts, and the Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning it, at Claſſicall Conuenticles, and like aſſemblies?
Did not theſe likewiſe ſhoote at the ouerthrowe of the whole
ſtate Eccleſiaſticall, and at the diſplacing of her Maieſties moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Counſel, and that vnder pretence of Reformation, &amp; to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
the preaching of the Goſpel in euery congregation through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this land? Made not theſe the like complaints of wicked <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
Noble men,</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> for keeping out the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> for
perſecuting ſincere Preachers, &amp; afflicting Gods people, like lyons
and Dragons? And doe they not pretend this to bee a ſpeciall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
of theirs, that the common people of euery Congregation
may not elect their owne Miniſters? that the people are brought
vnder the yoke of the lawe Ceremoniall, by paying tythes, &amp;c. and
is not the hand and head of <hi>Satan,</hi> as plainely in this action, to ſeeke
the ouerthrowe of ſound profeſſors, by others of the ſame profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
vnder pretence of greater ſinceritie? Doe not theſe likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
appropriate to themſelues and their fauorites, the tennes of
Gods Church, of Chriſtian brethren, and of true &amp; reformed Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers?
Is any ſpeech more rife in their mouthes, then that they will
only be tried and iudged by Gods booke, and by his ſpirit? Do they
not taxe all other men (not ſo farre gone as themſelues) of looſe
liues, of Antichriſtianiſme, of Hypocriſie, &amp; Idolatrie: in the meane
time, neuer looking at their owne treaſons, diſloyalties, and other
vices? Make they not great oſtentation of loue and fidelitie to her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9293:50"/>
Maieſties Perſon, and of care of her ſafetie, euen when they ſecretly
nouriſhed a fanſie of forfeiture of her Crowne, &amp; ſought to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
her by <hi>Hacket</hi> their imagined Soueraigne King of <hi>Europe?</hi> Had
they not their Cabinet Preachers, their table-end teachers, their
guides of Faſts, &amp;c. that teach, pray for, &amp; attend <hi>extraordinarie</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
by viſions, dreames, reuelations, &amp; <hi>enlightnings?</hi> Was not <hi>Giles
Wigginton</hi> &amp; ſome others vnto them, as <hi>Thomas Muncer,</hi> &amp; <hi>Phifer</hi>
were to the <hi>Germanes,</hi> men of ſuppoſed great auſteritie of life, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
fauour with God, reſoluteneſſe in his cauſe, ſingleneſſe, and

he gathered, touching <hi>extraordinarie</hi> callings in theſe dayes, by
reaſon of the great waſte of this Church of <hi>England?</hi> Had not hee
and they likewiſe learned of the ſame Deuill (in the prayers at faſts)
to aſke ſignes and ſeales of God, for their extraordinarie callings?
Doth not <hi>Arthington</hi> ſay, that he importuned God in his prayers?
and <hi>Coppinger,</hi> that hee had leaue giuen to talke more familiarly
with God then afore? Did not <hi>Hacket</hi> in praying for the pretended
poſſeſſed Gentlewoman, ſawcily expoſtulate with God, &amp; charge
him with his promiſe, as if he dealt not well with him? Did he not at
his Arraignement and Execution, ſhewe ſuch anger in his prayers
againſt God, thinking belike, as thoſe did, to be excuſed by his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie
of zeale? Did not both hee and <hi>Coppinger</hi> pretend confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

condemne the contrary deeper, then to haue an equalitie amongs
all perſons Eccleſiaſticall? Doe they not inueigh ſharpely againſt
Prince and Nobles, for vpholding the ſtate Eccleſiaſtical, and in this
reſpect intended to haue them brought to repentance, when their
opinions grew to a ripeneſſe? Was not this their principal pretended
purpoſe, to plant the Goſpel and their Reformation by rooting out
wicked <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Counſellors</hi> (as they iudged) and by ſetting
others in their places? Did <hi>Hackets</hi> fanſied Fanne in ſtead of Chriſt,
to ſeuer the good fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bad, import any thing els, or ſhould it haue
ſerued any other turne, then for the killing vp of al that thought not
wel of their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> &amp; <hi>Reformation?</hi> Did they not pretend the wil
of the Lord ſo to be? And was it not plainly ment, this to be effected
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9293:51"/>
by tumult of the common people? did not theſe likewiſe beare one
another in hand, that all things ſhould ſucceede and proſper with
them? that no violence could harme them, nor any man had power
to hurt them, as hauing <hi>Angelicall</hi> Spirits, and being in moſt high
fauour with God? and <hi>Hacket</hi> accordingly (euen in going to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
did he not call for and expect a miraculous deliuerance from
Heauen, out of the hands of thoſe, whom he called his enemies? Did
he not likewiſe (for a certaine ſigne of his fauour with God) make
<hi>Coppinger</hi> beleeue, that he coulde and did obtaine raine, and coulde
ſtay it at his pleaſure? Was not the chiefeſt of their plots and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies
detected by their letters founde with them? Did not they
likewiſe when they were conuented before the Magiſtrate, ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; reſolutely defend their dealings, and maintaine, that the <hi>Prince</hi>
had forfaited her right, and was now to be bridled &amp; ouer-ruled by
others? and laſtly, was not that impious wretch <hi>Hacket</hi> as irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
deiected, and baſe-minded towards his death, as <hi>Muncer,</hi> or
any man either could be, or as ſo bad a cauſe might procure?</p>
               <p>Not long after thoſe former rebellions in <hi>Germanie,</hi> another
ſtrange and memorable Commotion happened in <hi>Munſter,</hi> the
principall Citie of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> a Prouince alſo of <hi>Germanie:</hi> which is
not vnmeete to be (in ſome poynts) alſo touched in this place, for
the neere reſemblance that it hath vnto this late action.</p>
               <p>After the ſuppreſſion of this former Rebellion,<note place="margin">Sleydan. lib. 6.</note> and about the
yeere of the Lord 1527. <hi>Anabaptistrie</hi> began mightily to ſpreade
it ſelfe in ſundry partes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> euen as Cockle and Darnell
doth (by the ſowing of the enuious man the Deuill) among good
wheate. It happened that in the yeere 1532. one <hi>Bernard Rotman</hi>
firſt,<note place="margin">Idem. lib. 10.</note> &amp; afterward fiue others (ſent to aſſiſt him from the <hi>Lantzgraue
of Heſſe)</hi> began to preach the Goſpell truely, in and about the ſayde
Citie of <hi>Munſter.</hi> In the yeere 1533. one <hi>Iohn</hi> ſurnamed of <hi>Leyded</hi>
a towne in <hi>Holland</hi> (hauing none other knowen ſurname, by reaſon
of his ignobilitie, being but a Cobler, or a Currier by his occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
came vnto the Citie of <hi>Munſter.</hi> This Cobler was an egregious
<hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> vnder pretence of profeſſing the Goſpel, &amp; of an hatred
he had of <hi>Popery,</hi> hee inſinuated himſelfe into the acquaintance of
the Preachers of the Citie of <hi>Munſter:</hi> but when it happened once
that in anſwere to a queſtion of his (in that behalfe made) they told
him, that yong infants ought to be baptized, he laughed at them, as
it were in ſcorne and of pitie of their ignoraunce. Not long after
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9293:51"/>
this, one <hi>Herman Staprede,</hi> a Preacher came alſo thither: but hee
preached openly againſt the baptiſme of yong children. By theſe
meanes (but eſpecially by their ſecret aſſemblies and conuenticles
by night) this hereſie of <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> ſpred it ſelfe largely through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Citie, ſo that great ſpeeche was made in euery place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
albeit no certaine knowledge was had, becauſe they admitted
none other to their cloſe aſſemblies but ſuch, as ſtoode alike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.
This their courſe beeing come to the Magiſtrates eares,
all that fauoured that opinion, and had aſſembled themſelues in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch dangerous conuenticles, were (by a generall Edict) bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the Citie: but as they went out at one gate, ſo (being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
vpon their multitudes) they returned in at another: pretending
that they were commaunded by God to ſtay there, and to deale
more earneſtly and reſolutely in their buſineſſe. It happened, that
<hi>Rotman</hi> (who before had preached againſt them) beganne at that
time, to ſhewe himſelfe to be a fauourer of their opinions: which
thing gaue alſo great incouragement vnto them, inſomuch as they
then chalenged the ſound Preachers (which ſtoode againſt them)
vnto diſputation. But when this chalenge was accepted, ſo that
learned and graue Iudges and aſſiſtants might be choſen, and that
whatſoeuer ſhould be determined, might firmely be ſtoode vnto,
and obſerued of all without further contradiction: then they
ſhrunke backe, and refuſed diſputation vpon any ſuch conditions.
Hereupon they beganne to be leſſe eſteemed with the people, then
they were afore; therefore to recouer their former reputation with
them, they deuiſed another more ſhort and plauſible courſe, which
was this. About the ende of <hi>December,</hi> one of them pretending to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1533"/>
be diuinely inſpired, and to be rauiſhed in ſpirite, did goe through
the ſtreetes of the Citie, crying, <hi>Repent, Repent, and bee againe bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
or elſe the iudgements and wrath of God will quickely and ſuddenly
ouerwhelme you.</hi> By this occaſion, many of them which afore did
lurke ſecretly in corners, and kept themſelues cloſe, came ſuddenly
abroad, and in great routes and plumpes ranne together (with the
former crye) into the chiefe ſtreete of the Citie beeing the Market
place, making great outcryes, that all which were not <hi>rebaptized</hi>
in token of repentance, ſhould be ſlaine as heathens, and as vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men. After this, (with ſundry great outrages done by them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
many of the Citizens) they inueſted themſelues of the <hi>Guyld
hall</hi> or Towne-houſe, and of all the Artillerie and Munition of the
Citie: ſo that many perſons, what vpon credulous ſimplicitie, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9293:52"/>
what for ſauing their goods and liues, were content to bee <hi>rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
with them. Neuertheleſſe, others (for ſauegard of their goods
and themſelues in this perillous vprore) betooke themſelues to a
place in the Towne, very ſtrong by naturall ſituation, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
many of the ſeditious <hi>Anabaptiſtes</hi> for priſoners. Theſe
ſkirmiſhes laſted betwixt both the parties, vntill they grewe to a
parley and compoſition, giuing hoſtages eche to other, for obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
of it. And albeit the ſayde <hi>Rotman,</hi> and one <hi>Bernarde Cnip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdoling</hi>
(being chiefe in the faction) had alſo allowed of ſuch
compoſition: yet by their ſundry Letters, priuily and vnder hande
ſent vnto others of their faction and ſecte in places and Cities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
they trecherouſly (from time to time) inuited very many,
(though it were with loſſe of their goods abroade) to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to dwell at <hi>Munſter:</hi> aſſuring them of tenne times as much,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1534"/> as they did forgoe. Heereby the Citie beganne to bee repleniſhed
with ſtrangers of that faction, inſomuch as moſt of the wealthie
and graue Citizens, fearing whereunto it might tende, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Citie, and left it to the <hi>Anabaptiſtes,</hi> and to the reſt of the
common ſort. Thus becomming maſters of the place, they by and
by put out all the olde <hi>Senators</hi> or <hi>Counſellours</hi> of that eſtate, and
the two <hi>Conſuls</hi> (beeing the chiefe Magiſtrates) and put others in
their places, and namely they called <hi>Cnipperdoling</hi> to bee one of
their <hi>Conſulles.</hi> Then they fell to burne, ryflle and deface the
Churches, and in plumpes went through the ſtreetes, crying,
<hi>Repent, Repent:</hi> and immediatly after, <hi>Auoyde all yee wicked, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perill of your liues.</hi> Whereupon all the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in Armes, and (according to their proclamation) draue out of
the Citie, all whome they ſuppoſed not to be of their ſecte, without
regard either of age or ſexe. Inſomuch as diuers wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with childe
through the great throng and their ouerhaſtie departing, pitifully
miſcaried. This baniſhing &amp; proſcription happened the very day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the Citie being alſo temporall lord thereof, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his ſiege againſt the towne, for reuolting from his obedience.
In the middeſt of all theſe outrages, ſundry (calling themſelues <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets)</hi>
did ariſe vp amongſt them; who pretended to haue <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie</hi>
callings, gifts, functions, and reuelations from God; the chiefe
whereof was one <hi>Iohn Matthewe,</hi> next to him was the ſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Leyden,</hi> and then <hi>Cnipperdoling, Crecthing</hi> and ſome others. This
<hi>Matthew</hi> (their principal <hi>Prophet)</hi> charged euery man (vpon paine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9293:52"/>
of death) to bring all his gold, ſiluer, &amp; moueable goods into a great
common ſtorehouſe appoynted for that purpoſe, to the ende they
might be vſed &amp; beſtowed in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon: for ſo he proteſted to them,
it was the wil of his heauenly Father. The people were greatly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with this rigorous Edict; neuertheleſſe they obeyed, though
ſore againſt their wils. Neither was it poſſible (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out great danger)
for any to conceale or hide any part from them, becauſe there were
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie two gyrles, ſoothſayers, that did reueale whatſoeuer was
concealed, at leaſt ſo it was beleeued. Then the ſayde <hi>Matthewe</hi>
commanded euery one to bring all his bookes whatſoeuer (ſauing
the <hi>holy Bible)</hi> to be publikely burned, which was accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed.
Thus taking great confidence &amp; boldneſſe that his heſtes
and aduiſes were ſo readily obeyed, and had ſo good ſucceſſe; hee
moſt inſolently and cruelly thruſt in with a Pike, and after ſhotte in
with a Harquebuze one <hi>Hubert Trueteling,</hi> onely for a merie ieſte
that he made, touching one of their Prophets. Yet ſeeing that hee
did not die thereof out of hand, the ſayde <hi>Prophet</hi> tolde them, it was
reuealed to him from heauen, that <hi>Trueteling</hi> ſhould liue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
and that God had forgiuen him. Neuertheleſſe, hee dyed of
his wounds within fewe dayes after. Then <hi>Matthewe</hi> got into his
hand a long pyke; and running haſtily therewith through the
Towne towards the gates, he proclaymed as he went, that God the
Father had commanded him to beate backe all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
them) from the towne. But beeing met neere the campe, by
one onely ſouldier, he was by him thruſt through, and ſo died. And
albeit the falſehoode of his forged propheſies was thus twiſe dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
yet the other prophets (his companions) did ſo diſguiſe the
matter, &amp; bewitch the people, that they could not perceiue his cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
but did rather much lament his death, as a matter ominating
ſome great miſhap towards them, for that ſo excellent a man was
taken away. Yet <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> comforted them, ſaying, that God
had reuealed vnto him long before, that <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhould haue ſuch
an end, and that he ſhould marrie his widow. Some few daies after,
<hi>Cnipperdoling</hi> alſo propheſied, <hi>that high mountaines ſhould be brought
low, and the poore and meane ſhould be exalted:</hi> and thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all which was left ſtanding of the Churches to be demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
euen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ground: aſſuring them (and that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a conſtant ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
grauitie and great earneſtneſſe) that this commandement came
from God himſelfe: &amp; in further accompliſhment (as may ſeeme)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9293:53"/>
of ſuch his propheſie: <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> gaue to the ſaide <hi>Cuipperdoling</hi>
the ſworde of execution, and ſo made him the common hangman
of the Citie, that immediatly afore was <hi>Conſull</hi> and chiefe Officer.
This office of Executioner (belike vpon compact betweene them)
he willingly accepted, and obeyed <hi>Leyden</hi> therein, as the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God. Now after that ſome aſſaults had bene made againſt
the Citie, by the Biſhops Armie beſieging it, (albeit with no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe)
<hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> layde him downe to reſt, and dreamed three
dayes together. Being awaked, hee ſpake not a worde to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but calling for paper, writte downe the names of twelue men
(whereof ſome were in deede Gentlemen of blood) who ſhoulde
haue the ſoueraigne charge of all, and ſhould gouerne the Citie, as
the heads of the tribes did in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for ſo he ſayd, it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly
Fathers will. But hereby (in very trueth) he layde the foundation
of a kingdome, whereunto he aſpired. Then hee propounded vnto
their reformed Preachers, certaine articles to be reſolued in by the
Scriptures alone: by which if they could not confute them, then he
would (as he ſayd) put them vp vnto the people, that by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
they might be eſtabliſhed. The effect of them was, that a
man was not bound vnto one wife, but might marry ſo many as
him ſelfe luſted. When their Preachers made ſome difficultie and
ſticking at it, hee called them into the <hi>Counſell houſe,</hi> together with
the twelue new <hi>Gouernours</hi> or <hi>Elders.</hi> Then he put off his cote and
layde it and the new Teſtament downe together afore them, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by thoſe two (as by aſſured tokens) that the articles by him
propoſed, were reueiled vnto him from heauen, &amp; that God would
neuer bee mercifull vnto them, if they did not yeelde vnto them.
Hereupon they gaue their aſſents, and after (for three dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
they preached of nothing but of marriage. Then <hi>Leyden</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
three wiues: one whereof was the widowe of their great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Matthewe</hi> lately deceaſed, and diuers other followed the like
example, as if it had bene a matter moſt allowable and lawdable.
But ſome of the Citizens (of better diſpoſition) finding this courſe
to be moſt abominable, gaue a watch word through the towne for
all that truely fauoured the Goſpel without fantaſtical nouelties, to
come into the Market place: where being aſſembled, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<hi>Leyden, Cuipperdoling,</hi> and all the reſt of their <hi>Prophets.</hi> But
when the common people were aduertiſed hereof, they ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
tooke Armes, and reſcued the priſoners from them. The
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9293:53"/>
people alſo layde handes on them, which had apprehended their
<hi>Prophets,</hi> putting them to death with moſt exquiſite tormentes:
namely, they faſtened fiftie of them vnto trees, and ſhotte at them
with harquebuzes, their great Prophet (all the while) crying thus
vnto them, that he that would doe God good ſeruice, ſhould firſt
ſhoote at them; and others were put vnto ſundry other ſeuerall
kindes of death.</p>
               <p>In the Moneth of <hi>Iuly</hi> that yeere, a new prophet (being a golde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith
by his trade) did ariſe vp amongs them: who hauing called
the multitude together into the Market ſteede, ſignified vnto them,
it was the will and commaundement of the heauenly Father, that
<hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> ſhould bee <hi>Emperour</hi> of all the earth; and that hee
marching forth with a puiſſant armie, ſhould deſtroy all Kings and
Princes, but ſhould ſpare the common people that loued righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſynceritie, to the intent hee may holde the ſeate of <hi>Dauid</hi>
his father, vntill the heauenly Father ſhould receiue againe the
kingdome: for (ſayd he) godly men muſt onely rule in the worlde,
after they haue once diſpatched all the wicked out of the way.
When the <hi>Prophet</hi> had ended theſe ſpeeches, ſuddenly <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
kneeled downe, and lifting vp his handes to heauen, ſay de thus:
<hi>Brethren,</hi> it is a good while agone ſince I firſt knewe this, and yet
would not hitherto publiſh it abroade: but nowe the Father hath
vſed another Miniſter to bring it to paſſe and to proclayme it. So
hauing (by this ſubtiltie) compaſſed to bee King, hee firſt depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the twelue <hi>Gouernours,</hi> and after the maner of other Kings, did
chooſe and create ſundry to be great Lordes about him: hee alſo
cauſed two Crownes of pure golde to be made for himſelfe, and a
Royall robe, coller and ſcepter, with other complements of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.
He aſſigned alſo certaine dayes, wherein he would giue audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to all complaynants and ſuters. Whenſoeuer he came abroad,
he was attended with his Officers and gentlemen of his Court, and
with two yong henchmen on horeſebacke, the one on his righthand
carying the <hi>Bible,</hi> and the other on his left, carying a drawen ſword.
He had alſo a magnifical Throne prepared and ſet on high for him,
with a golden cloth of Eſtate. At a certaine time, when the King
was thus ſet in his Maieſtie, and the people thronged cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about him, <hi>Cuipperdoling</hi> one of the prophets, gotte vpon the
peoples heads; and ſo creeping along on his hands and feete, hee
breathed vpon them in their mouthes one after another, ſaying
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9293:54"/>
thus: the Father hath ſanctified thee, receiue the holy Ghoſt. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
weekes after, the new Prophet (afore mentioned) cauſed (by
ſounde of a Trumpet) to bee proclaymed, that all ſhould retyre
themſelues in armes vnto the Churchyard of the chiefe Church,
for that the enemie muſt be repelled from the towne. Comming
thither, they found a great ſupper ready prepared. Then there ſate
downe to ſupper (as they were commaunded) foure thouſand: and
after theſe had ſupped, one thouſand moe (that had wayted) ſate
downe. The <hi>King</hi> alſo, and the chiefe <hi>Queene,</hi> together with their
courtiers did ſerue at table. The ſupper being towards an ende, the
king gaue bread vnto euery one of them, ſaying, <hi>Take, eate, and ſhew
forth the Lordes death.</hi> Then the <hi>Queene</hi> preſented them with the
cup, ſaying, <hi>Drinke, and ſhew forth the Lords death.</hi> This being done,
the ſaid prophet got him vp into a pulpit, and asked them if they
would obey the word of the Lord? which when they had yeelded
vnto that they would, he ſaide it was the <hi>Fathers</hi> commandement,
that eight and twentie <hi>Doctors</hi> or <hi>Teachers</hi> ſhould be ſent forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the corners of the world, to teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine that was taught
and receiued in that Citie. Then he named them all, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
place whitherech of them ſhould goe. So after all was done,
they let the ſaid eight and twentie Preachers out of the towne by
night very cloſely, for feare of thoſe without, who beſieged them:
giuing to euery one (aboue that which ſhould defray his charges)
one peece of gold, and commanding them to leaue it at ſuch places
where their doctrine ſhould not be receiued, for a teſtimony of ſuch
peoples damnation, &amp; euerlaſting perdition, for refuſing ſuch meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
&amp; wholeſome doctrine. When thoſe Preachers were come to
the places aſſigned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they cryed in the ſtreets of the townes
where they came, <hi>Repent, repent, or els you ſhall all quickly periſh.</hi> Then
they ſpred their garments on the ground before the Magiſtrates, &amp;
vpon them they laid the pieces of gold which were afore deliuered
vnto them, aſſuring them, and proteſting that they were ſent from
the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, to bring them peace &amp; mercy: and if they would
receiue it, then they muſt giue vp all their goods to be vſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
but if they refuſed it, then that ſigne &amp; token ſhould be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
againſt them of ingratitude &amp; rebellion againſt God. For (ſayd
they) now is the time come that was ſpoken of afore by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Prophets,</hi>
in which righteouſnes ſhall reigne in the earth vniuerſally; &amp; when
the <hi>King</hi> (meaning <hi>Iohn a Leyden)</hi> hath brought to paſſe, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9293:54"/>
ſhal rule in euery place, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhal giue vp his kingdom
to his Father. But theſe preachers being hereupon apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, they
reſolutely ſtood in it, &amp; defended, that they onely held the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which they would mainteine vpon peril of their liues. Being
asked, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what iuſtice they could enter vpon, and poſſeſſe other mens
wiues, children &amp; goods as they did? they ſaid, The time was come
foreſpoken of by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>the meeke ſhould poſſeſſe the earth,</hi> &amp; that
God gaue theſe vnto them, as he did giue the goods of the <hi>Egyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi>
vnto the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> They affirmed alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> king <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn a Leyden</hi>
were two righteous prophets: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; <hi>Luther</hi> were both falſe
prophets: whereof <hi>Luther</hi> was the worſe. Thus ſtil perſiſting obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their erroneous opinions (not withſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tortures which
they endured) they were al beheaded, ſauing one of them, that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
away by flight. Whiles theſe things were thus in doing within
and abroad, the citie of <hi>Munſter</hi> was euery day more &amp; more ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beſieged, and preſſed with extreme famine, ſo that for feare leſt
many y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe <hi>Burgers</hi> ſhould capitulate with the enemie, &amp; yeelde
the <hi>King</hi> vp vnto the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> their <hi>King</hi> therefore did chuſe twelue,
whom he held moſt faithful vnto him, &amp; appointed them to be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of warre ouer ſo many ſeueral parts of the towne, into which
he did quarter it: entertayning the ſaid twelue perſons with moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of large promiſes, and telling them ouer what great Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
&amp; Dominions vnder him he would after place them. Thus the
famine ſtil more &amp; more encreaſing in the Citie (ſo that ſundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereof, albeit the <hi>King</hi> had abundance for himſelfe &amp; his ſpecial
fauourites, not onely for ſupply of neceſſitie, but alſo to ryot &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet)
it happened, that one of his <hi>Queenes</hi> in commiſeration of the
diſtreſſed, ſaid vnto the reſt, that ſhee could not beleeue it was the
wil of God, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould in that ſort be ſuffred to die for want of
food. Hereupon being accuſed, ſhe was brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> market place,
&amp; being commanded to kneele down, the king ſtrake off her head;
al the reſt of his <hi>Queenes</hi> ſinging, dancing, &amp; giuing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks therfore
to the <hi>heauenly Father.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort had like to haue
mutined, by reaſon of the extremitie of famine, their <hi>King</hi> promiſed
them aſſured deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from God before <hi>Eaſter.</hi> When <hi>Eaſter</hi> was
come, no ſigne or toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce appeared. Then the king
fained himſelf to be ſicke for ſixe dayes: afterward (aſſembling the
people into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> market ſteed) he told them, that all that while he had
ridden vpon a blinde Aſſe, and that <hi>the Father</hi> had laid vpon him
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9293:55"/>
the ſinnes of the whole multitude, ſo that now they were cleanſed
and freed from all vice: which was the deliuerance which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
vnto them, &amp; therewith they were to holde themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.
When the <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſtrength, by common ſupplies from the
<hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> were much ree<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forced, matters (in the town)
grewe to that extremitie, that by meanes of two perſons (who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
themſelues ſecretly forth of the towne) it was at laſt ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the aſſaylants, though with much adoe and bloodſhed, euen
after they were entred. Their <hi>King,</hi> with <hi>Cuipperdoling</hi> and <hi>Crecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
their two falſe prophets were taken aliue: but <hi>Rotman</hi> their
<hi>Reformed preacher</hi> (ſeeing no hope to eſcape) deſperately ranne in
amongs the thickeſt of the armed companies, and by them he was
cut in pieces. The three perſons aforenamed were caryed about
the countrey, as a ſpectacle to ſundry the <hi>Princes</hi> and others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
and after were brought backe againe vnto <hi>Munſter.</hi> The
<hi>Biſhoppe</hi> of <hi>Munſter</hi> demaunded of the <hi>King,</hi> by what authoritie he
tooke vpon him to rule in that Citie? who asked the ſayde <hi>Biſhoppe</hi>
againe, by what authoritie he the ſayd <hi>Biſhoppe</hi> claymed any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
there? When he anſwered, that he had it by meanes of election
of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> and by conſent of the people, the <hi>King</hi> replying,
ſayde, that himſelfe had his authoritie from God. After two dayes
had bene beſtowed with them, to reduce them (by godly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions)
from their errours, <hi>Leyden</hi> their <hi>King</hi> confeſſed his ſinne, and
deſired for giueneſſe at <hi>Chriſtes</hi> handes. But <hi>Cuipperdoling</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliting</hi>
would confeſſe no fault, but defended their courſe and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
with great obſtinacie. So all three being tyed vnto poſtes,
were diſmembred by peece meale, and pulled in ſmall peeces with
hotte burning pinſers and tongs, and afterward their carkaſes were
hanged vp there in yron cages; but the <hi>King</hi> in the midſt, and much
higher then the other two, as his place required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides certaine eſpecial opinions which theſe</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>held,
namely, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> yong childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not to be baptized, <hi>&amp;</hi> touching lawfulneſſe,
of Poligamie or hauing many wiues: Of communitie of goods, <hi>and that</hi>
Chriſt tooke not fleſh of the virgin Mary &amp;c. <hi>they alſo taught and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
many other ſtrange, erroneous and hereticall poſitions: and
yet they ſhewed as much deuotion, outward holines and puritie, as
might be. As for example, they held theſe folowing: viz.</hi> that a perfit
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might not exerciſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of a Magiſtrat, nor might take an oth
before him: <hi>that</hi> God doth now ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ſhew his will by extraordinarie
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9293:55"/>
reuelations, dreames, and viſions: <hi>That</hi> the common people haue an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
authoritie in determining and eſtabliſhing of Chruch cauſes: <hi>That</hi>
before the day of iudgement the kingdome of Chriſt ſhalbe ſuch, as that
the godly and elect, ſhall ouerthrow &amp; ſubdue all the wicked, and then they
alone ſhall rule in the earth: <hi>That</hi> it is lawfull for the people to depoſe and
put downe the Prince or Magiſtrate: <hi>That</hi> Miniſters and others godly
affected, ought to eſtabliſh (though it were by force) a Reformation in all
Countries: <hi>That</hi> Princes and Magiſtrates ought not to purſue this kinde
of perſons, for that they are innocents and the beloued people of God: <hi>That</hi>
the ſeate of Dauid which was fallen downe muſt bee reeſtabliſhed, and
that Chriſt nowe in the latter ende of the worlde ſhall reigne externally
vpon the earth: <hi>That</hi> the time of beſiege (they then liued in) was that
whereof Eſaie prophecied, wherein the iuſt and godly were afflicted and
perſecuted: <hi>That</hi> the time of their deliuerance and enlargement was at
hand: which ſhould be like to that deliuerance of the Iſraelites from the
thraldome vnder the Babylonians: <hi>And that</hi> then the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
ſhall receiue the guerdon and recompenſe of all their impieties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt the ſaints, all the vngodly being ridde out of the way, the
ſeate of righteouſneſſe ſhould bee prepared and aduanced: <hi>That</hi> there is
none efficacie or force in that baptiſme, wherewith infants are baptized.
<hi>All which they obſtinately defended, and yet (whenſoeuer they
were charged) they pretended that</hi> they woulde acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
their errors, if they ſhoulde bee ſhewed vnto them by the Scriptures,
to be errours.</p>
               <p>Nowe as I haue done afore, in the Hiſtorie of <hi>Thomas Muncer,</hi>
I muſt craue leaue, that with the readers patience, I may alſo briefly
compare and reſemble ſome of the dealings and errours of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi>
of the Citie of <hi>Munſter,</hi> with the actions and opinions

               <p>For did not <hi>Hacket</hi> (the moſt ignorant of all the three, being but
an vnlettered Maltſter) in like ſort take vpon him to rule the other,
and to mannage the whole action? and are not the moſt ignorant
of ſuch as be of this humor, moſt preſumptuous to direct all others,
and to diſcuſſe deepeſt doubts? Haue not their mutuall cohortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſeditious inſtructions, with their conceiued prayers, and
hypocriticall Faſts, (that they practiſed in priuie conuenticles, and

of numbers? Haue not the Magiſtrates now as great cauſe to looke

into theſe proceedings, before they make head, vpon confidence of
their multitudes? Haue not all the ſtayed and ſounde Preachers of

Will they make any haſte, or dare they to offer diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if ſuch conditions, aſſiſtants, and indifferent and learned

of <hi>Repent, Repent,</hi> &amp;c. and by gathering of Routes, tending to

his kingdome? for ſo they (blaſphemouſly) terme <hi>the
Diſcipline,</hi> which they haue forged? Was not the diſplacing of
her Maieſties <hi>Counſell</hi> plotted by the Confederates, and had
they not aſſigned other <hi>Counſellors</hi> in their roomes? Should thoſe,
whome themſelues had thus choſen and aſſigned, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
long in place, if their <hi>King Hacket,</hi> had bene once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted,
as fully and royally as <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Leiden</hi> was in <hi>Munſter?</hi>
Woulde they not quickely haue brought them downe, as <hi>Cnip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdoling</hi>
was, from being <hi>Conſull</hi> to the baſeſt roome of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
that might bee? woulde theſe (if they had preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9293:56"/>
haue ſpared (thinke yee) either place, age, or ſexe, or
ſhoulde baniſhment onely haue ſerued? No: <hi>Viſcera impiorum
crudelia.</hi> And did not <hi>Hacket</hi> take vpon him to bee as great a
<hi>Prophet,</hi> as <hi>Iohn Matthewe,</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Leiden</hi> his ſucceſſor?
and <hi>Coppinger</hi> the <hi>Prophet of Gods mercie,</hi> as high as <hi>Cnipperdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</hi>
and <hi>Arthington</hi> the <hi>Prophet of Iudgement,</hi> and <hi>penne of
a ready writer,</hi> as refined and excellent, as <hi>Crechting</hi> the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith?
had not theſe alſo appoynted out <hi>Wigginton</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi>
to bee their aſſiſtants for a time, as it were their petie
Prophets? Did they not pretende the will of the <hi>Heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
for euery moſt vngodly, and abſurd motion, ſpeech, or
action, as namely for the defacing of her <hi>Maieſties</hi> Armes: and
that ſhee ſhoulde not bee prayed for? Did not theſe pretend and
feigne, to bee in high fauour with God, and that they could
tell ſecretes, and things to come, meerely contingent, and to
bee able to caſt out Deuils, and to obtaine rayne at pleaſure?
matters of as great difficultie and vnlikelyhoode, as ſoothſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and bewraying of things concealed? Did they not inueigh
againſt the humane wiſedome (of diuers of their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
whome they ſuppoſed not to bee forwarde ynough?
and doe not many of the <hi>Diſciplinarian</hi> veine, deſpiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all helpes of good Artes and learning, as little leſſe
then impious, but ſpecially in Sermons? Was not <hi>Matthewe</hi>
the chiefe Prophet of <hi>Munſter</hi> his fanſie ſtronger, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
greater, then theſe Conſpirators ſhewed in any part
of their action: when hee thought himſelfe alone able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
an whole hoſte? and yet hee was not therefore accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
furious, madde, or diſtracted of his wits? Was not <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi>
likewiſe, as deepely bewitched as the people of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
when hee coulde not perceiue, that <hi>Hacket</hi> did but dally
with him, about particular intelligence of ſome treaſons, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to bee plotted by ſome great perſons? had not theſe
three, and this ſort of <hi>Humorists,</hi> as great enuie at olde and
<hi>Cathedrall</hi> Churches and others: when as they ſeeke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their ouerthrowe? Did not <hi>Coppinger</hi> fanſie, to haue had his
<hi>extraordinarie</hi> callings, and <hi>enlightnings,</hi> by dreames in his ſleepe?
Had they not likewiſe appoynted their gouernours for matters
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9293:57"/>
of <hi>Counſell,</hi> and for other ciuill adminiſtration? Doe not this
kinde of perſons alſo make ſhewe of deſire, to haue all queſtions
decided alonely by Scriptures? Doth not <hi>the Diſcipline</hi> giue the
chiefe and ſoueraigne allowance or diſallowance of all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
determinations, vnto the whole congregation? Did not theſe
Conſpirators vſe (as meanes to bee truſted that God had reuealed
ſuch things vnto them) othes and execrations of damnation and
confuſion to themſelues, as deepely as <hi>Iohn a Leiden</hi> did, when he
did ſweare by his coate, and by the newe Teſtament, touching the
like reuelation? Did not <hi>Hacket</hi> their great <hi>Prophet,</hi> thirſt after, and
threaten reuenge againſt ſome great perſons, who hee though did
ſtand in his way? Did not <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> proclaime in the
Market place of <hi>Chepe,</hi> and afterwarde defende, that <hi>Hacket</hi> was
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Emperor</hi> of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and that God had ſo appoynted it?
Did they not holde, that he together with themſelues, ſhoulde goe
forth, and take poſſeſſion of all his kingdomes here and abroade,
and ſubdue all kings, that woulde not holde their ſcepters of him,
and be gouerned by ſuch lawes and orders, as he ſhould appoynt:
and that he ſhould ſeuer with his Fanne, the good from the bad, ſo
that they ſhoulde not trouble and afflict the godly any more? Had
not <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo, his ſaid <hi>Prophets</hi> to proclaime him publikely <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leiden</hi> had the goldſmith? Did not <hi>Coppinger</hi>
(vpon <hi>Arthingtons</hi> aduertiſement) with three moſt lowly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances,
and with great grauitie, take vpon him, and was ready to
annoynt, and ſanctifie <hi>Hacket</hi> with the holy Ghoſt, but that (by a
ſhift) he was put off? and as they of <hi>Munſter</hi> had their prophane
and impious celebration of the Communion, before they ſent forth
their 28. Preachers; In like maner, had not theſe, their hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
faſts and prayers, promulgated and made knowen, vnto ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
of their owne diſpoſition, that they might ioyne (either in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
or ſpirit) with them, afore they enterpriſed any matter, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
conſultation of weight, or would aſſume their ſuppoſed <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie</hi>
callings? Doe not theſe, and all like affected to them,
by their teachers in euery corner, ſeeke to winne or perſwade, as
many to the liking of their opinions, as poſſibly they can any way
compaſſe, and hemme in? Haue they not alſo their ſette, emptie,
thundring wordes, and ſolemne obteſtations, to allure men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that, which they teach? Did not the ſaid two <hi>Engliſh Prophets,</hi>
offer by their Proclamation, great mercie and ioyes to them that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9293:57"/>
ſhould beleeue or follow them, and infinite woes and damnation,
to thoſe that ſhould reiect them? did they not ſignifie, that the
time was come for the eſtabliſhing the Goſpell and <hi>Reformation,</hi>
by their <hi>K. Hacket:</hi> and therefore willed all true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be of
good comfort, becauſe the wicked ſhould bee ouerthrowen? did
they not engage their liues, yea and ſoules, vpon the veritie of the
meſſages, that they publiſhed? and were they not a good while
(after their apprehenſion) very obſtinate and reſolute in their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
conceiued? was not <hi>Coppingers</hi> promiſes of ſpeedie deliuerance
vnto <hi>Vdall,</hi> as confident and reſolute as <hi>Iohn a Leidens</hi> was vnto the
people of that Citie? though the euent ſhewed, that at laſt all did
but come, to the <hi>riding of a blind aſſe?</hi> did not <hi>Hacket</hi> likewiſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly
affirme, that by the whipping which <hi>Pigge</hi> beſtowed
on him, he did ſuffer for the ſinnes of all hypocrite preachers, ſuch
as fauoured <hi>the diſcipline,</hi> but were not ſo forward, as hee thought
they ought to be? Was not the reſolution of one of theſe, as lewd
as <hi>Rotmans</hi> (who after all hope was paſt, ranne amongſt the armed
companies) if hee alſo did (as was ſayd) with like wilfulneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to take any ſuſtenance? was not the deſperateneſſe of <hi>Hacket</hi>
alſo moſt horrible and fearefull, when as (ſeeing no remedie but
death) he opened his mouth blaſphemouſly againſt heauen, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Maieſtie</hi> of the Eternall God?</p>
               <p>And concerning certaine opinions of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> doe not
many of the <hi>Diſciplinarian</hi> humour, come farre neerer vnto them
then were to be wiſhed? for though they denie not the ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
ſuperioritie altogether: yet in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, though
they admit it (in words) they allow vnto him nothing elſe but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of their orders without attributing any ſuperior prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of commaundement in church cauſes, for retaining of good
order, &amp; of ſoundneſſe of doctrine in the Church. Likewiſe, though
they take not the ſoueraigntie from the chiefe magiſtrate in cauſes
of the common wealth, doe they not ſo abridge and pound his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, that the very <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe attribute
as much in this behalfe vnto him, as they doe? And albeit they
will not abſolutely in iudgement denie the lawfulneſſe of an othe
before a magiſtrate, yet if their ſundrie and variable poſitions in
this point be marked, they doe (in effect wholy) repeale the vſe of
it. For doe not ſome of them plainly refuſe to take an othe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be vrged to diſcouer any thing which may either be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9293:58"/>
penall to themſelues, or to their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> brother, and ſo in effect
denie it altogether? Doe not others of them refuſe to tel any thing
that is criminall concerning any other perſon, though perhaps they
will doe it againſt themſelues, eſpecially when they thinke it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
diſcouered and knowen? Doe not ſome of them refuſe an othe
ſimplie, yea, and to anſwere (without othe) either affirmatiuely or
negatiuely, but doe will their accuſers to ſtand foorth? Doe not
others deny to take an othe, except euery particular queſtion be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made knowen vnto them: a matter impoſſible, becauſe ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
queſtions that ſhall be asked, doe ariſe foorth of the matter of
the anſwere? And doe not ſundry of them (albeit they yeeld to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
by othe both their own &amp; others offences) yet denie to reueale
any thing whereof they are asked, if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues be perſwaded the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
demanded of, be none offence? And ſo they do hang obedience
to lawes, allegeance and duetie of ſubiects, vpon euery particular
mans conceit, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he by circumſtances, or his own fond perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſhall liſt to meaſure matters, Do they not reſolutely hold, that
<hi>ſummapotestas,</hi> the chiefe and Soueraigne power in all church-cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
belongs to a Presbyterie, who though they may conſult, yet
may not determine matter of any moment, without the allowance
of the people? Had not theſe conſpirators a like opinion to thoſe
of <hi>Munſter,</hi> that the principall ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (being in <hi>Hacket)</hi> hee
was come with his fanne to ſeuer and diſpatch out of the way, all
the wicked and vngodly, from the good and godly? Hath it not
bene ſet downe by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubiect, and twiſe printed with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
allowance of the Engliſh <hi>Arch-prophet of diſcipline,</hi> for found
and <hi>holie diuinitie,</hi> that it is Gods ordinance, to haue in euery king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
certain chiefe officers (like <hi>Ephori</hi> in <hi>Lacedamon)</hi> who ſhould
haue authoritie to depoſe kings, though they come vnto it by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſucceſſion, if they ſhall iudge them to be tyrants? Did not <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginton</hi>
deliuer for ſound doctrine, that if the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> did not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
well, the people might draw themſelues together, and to ſee
a <hi>Reformation?</hi> Doe not theſe kind of perſons like wiſe ſlander the
<hi>Prince</hi> and ſtate, with perſecution of the ſaints, and of innocent
men, becauſe they are a little reſtrained from running on in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
courſes? Did not theſe conſpirators alſo hold, that now in
theſe later times, <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his principall ſpirit (imparted vnto <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket)</hi>
ſhould raine and erect an externall kingdom on earth, &amp; in the
world? And did they not fanſie, that euen at that time the Goſpell
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9293:58"/>
with their <hi>diſcipline,</hi> ſhould be vniuerſally eſtabliſhed, and all the
vngodlie aboliſhed? Doe not all of the <hi>Diſciplinarian</hi> ſecte holde,
that to the very being of baptiſme (and without which, it is of no
more force in any caſe, then the nurſes waſhing) it is required, that
it be adminiſtred by a lawfull Miniſter? thereby derogating, not
onely from the true baptiſme of thouſands, but alſo of all whome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer,
that were baptiſed by Popiſh ſacrificing Prieſtes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and from all that haue receaued baptiſme of ſuch, as were
baptiſed by them? whereupon muſt needes followe neceſſitie of
<hi>rebaptization,</hi> or elſe that it were lawfull to neglect and contemne
that Sacrament, and high myſterie of our ſaluation. Laſtly, do they
not make great ſhewes, and many pretenſes, for all their vnſound
and abſurd opinions, that they are taken from the holie and ſacred
written word of God? which by this meanes they make to be of
priuate interpretation, and do not reduce their ſenſes vnto it, when
they reade,<note place="margin">Scripturas ad ſuum non ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſenſum ad Scripturas ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducunt.</note> but doe wickedly captiuate the Scripture vnto their
owne ſenſes and meanings? euen as (in this behalfe) <hi>Coppinger</hi> or
<hi>Arthington</hi> did firſt take vpon them an <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling, and
were afterward charged by <hi>Hacket,</hi> to reade ouer the whole <hi>Bible,</hi>
there to finde an approbation of it.</p>
               <p>God of his infinite mercie forgiue, and turne the hearts of all
that trouble his Church, from running wel, or that impugne his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and ſuch as are ſet ouer them: and reſtraine, or roote out
all fantaſticall errours, &amp; fanatical ſpirites, which the enuious man
(from time to time) doeth ſowe amongs the good wheate: that
holding the vnitie of the ſpirite in the bond of peace, we may all
meete together (in the vnitie of faith, and knowledge of the Sonne
of God) vnto a perfite man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the
fulnes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo ſpeedily and ioyfully meete him our bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome
in the cloudes, with our heades lifted vp, and full of
comfort, and ſo reigne with him for euer, through the
ſame <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our Lorde: to whome with the

be all honour, praiſe, glorie and
